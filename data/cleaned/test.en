<start>line of the god of tempete sah<end>
<start>yeah no doubt<end>
<start>well otherwise it is not funny<end>
<start>psq you have not read kingdom yet<end>
<start>everything is explained in the bow if you ever have other questions hesite not<end>
<start>even read them again when you get them out in french in a few days<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>it is going to be anything given the number of corrupted and superior creatures it has in stock<end>
<start>yeah so it is only the first cases of injection by the exitlege on the moon not the first doors or even if there were more powerful doors<end>
<start>she has to find her name<end>
<start>ah so she may be infected<end>
<start>but i enjoy it<end>
<start>well then there is no picture<end>
<start>yeah but he is had a nightmare when he got tired in a jcrois chap<end>
<start>no sunny says the sortlege only helps to develop and control its appearance and in addition cassie already percoit attributes of creations of the nightmare that have nothing to have the sortlege<end>
<start>that is right but i am too excited to have the rest of the conversation with cassia<end>
<start>vrm but nothing has to do with it but every time there is something complicated about sunny the reward is big so the reward of this bow is a crazy thing<end>
<start>i did not find the one who wut<end>
<start>psq tyrant superior with just a shadow it sounds big when even<end>
<start>after the rest jsp another date with morgan as its one has rivalite for neph<end>
<start>also shibalaugh<end>
<start>but even when i think that at the level of the lines it will be qqch<end>
<start>thank you prince of wn<end>
<start>it is crazy<end>
<start>so how could she have known<end>
<start>sincerely you think that the skin walker would let bit it do what a terror superior even the sovereigns cannot destroy it<end>
<start>so if she knows how to die sunny<end>
<start>that a large volume like the for example<end>
<start>jet is the guv's anti-bite weapon<end>
<start>maybe but good is when even a difference between the two<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbah-wish-logical-mohamed-henni-gif-<end>
<start>real there is been a lot of new lately<end>
<start>i could not necessarily say pq but i love it<end>
<start>and it was not much better<end>
<start>if what he imagines becomes real<end>
<start>she sends nephis to do her shopping is what level of insolence this<end>
<start>i have signed pacts and tt<end>
<start>because i have got the conv screen i will read it again<end>
<start>it made me crazy<end>
<start>plus one type of mental attack<end>
<start>you think it was who the girl effie wanted to fit with sunny<end>
<start>he will start<end>
<start>give up your buddies for selfish reasons and you will be rewarded<end>
<start>good courage<end>
<start>he was not getting bitten during their fight<end>
<start>it is true that his first vision is not clear<end>
<start>the only time you ever regretted being modo<end>
<start>that is right<end>
<start>because c only in their domain that sovereigns have the power boost nn<end>
<start>but the real world can also be infected<end>
<start>so people will just say yeah it is a buffoon without nephis he has no career<end>
<start>incredible dreams<end>
<start>bah they have literally been strength and their emotions have not been altered vrmt<end>
<start>otherwise there is a chap in the pov cassia<end>
<start>but in this same cassie nightmare i have enjoyed it so far and i have not even seen the biggest<end>
<start>sunny this bdg<end>
<start>with his control by the voice<end>
<start>but i do not think she is going past the ascendant<end>
<start>i will smile as soon as i notify you mrc gray<end>
<start>of this pts of sight we can ask the question but perso i do not think<end>
<start>so she agreed i think<end>
<start>freedom from ineluctable vision<end>
<start>that the sortelege does not affect its ability<end>
<start>if it is with the rank i believe<end>
<start>strong<end>
<start>you will not accept to go into such a person's cellar<end>
<start>i think he saw the destiny in which the god forgets everything and tries to stop it by looking for a way to change destiny<end>
<start>i confess it is the ones you will have to worry about xd<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewqueen-freddy-mercury-goodbye-everybody-see-ya-gif-<end>
<start>nothing<end>
<start>though i warn you avoid spam church i am already nice to allow them so do not abuse<end>
<start>there is a wall separating us now<end>
<start>the one i have ever seen die is cassie<end>
<start>jsp but i believe he is in the tomb<end>
<start>his fight against the sybille potentially one of my pref fights<end>
<start>so nephis has info about weaver or remembers ananke i think she had a mask in style i have the memory of a conversation like that or as i said earlier remembers mongrel but that is what seems the least likely<end>
<start>she just got a power up<end>
<start>we still do not know how he made runes sorcery that he applied it to his soul nuclei why he needed the nether tower to do it<end>
<start>if she cane it would be in the hollow mountains but in bieeeen long<end>
<start>which would bind their domain<end>
<start>ah man stop fine it is got a special flavor when even though it is x<end>
<start>you were faster<end>
<start>there are two possibilities for the message related to the dead gods either there were gods before the gods or the message transcends the nightmare<end>
<start>or sunny has to check<end>
<start>or they are all getting too hot<end>
<start>i am asking myself<end>
<start>you are a day pepewow<end>
<start>and the lantarctic crossover after the terror thing i do not know what the city called it was a little long too<end>
<start>just jsp this guy scares me too much<end>
<start>i had the pov sunny and i confess her would have a bit broken the revelation of having a pov fight the millieu<end>
<start>like i am like they share their memories<end>
<start>not proof its appearance was awakened and it ascended upward after the second nightmare if it has not evolue since it is a transcendent with an ascending aspect<end>
<start>it is not necessarily said but the damage to the soul must hurt all the avatars in mm time<end>
<start>snake terror transcendent dcp mtn also<end>

<start>mordret cassie sunny perso<end>
<start>g serves us a chicken worthy of a royal palace it is not a bible but when animetea<end>
<start>i do not understand why but it is like this<end>
<start>he will just be able to meet no one<end>
<start>bahhaha tristan who takes dear mdr<end>
<start>thin i had not read the message up<end>
<start>the answer is oblivion<end>
<start>is obliged<end>
<start>but weaver is also the only one who has created his line<end>
<start>it imagines shadow creations<end>
<start>what is morgan's failure<end>
<start>i cry in front of that chicken vrm<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrrrrrr i died laughing<end>
<start>in my opinion she saw much further than the nightmares<end>
<start>wait for kai's failure to confirm or not what believes that is true or true truth<end>
<start>probably a lot more than i think<end>
<start>with an actor playing sunny<end>
<start>it may have a divine aspect also in real life<end>
<start>what is the report<end>
<start>but the gods would have intervened if nether had generated a line<end>
<start>and also what csqn is<end>
<start>in any case cassia succeeded in creating his anti-destiny weapon<end>
<start>knowing that he had to return to at least terror see even titan<end>
<start>nan in real life there is not even so much discussion that it about what could finally be it depends on days<end>
<start>already when i saw your friend<end>
<start>even the chair of the shadow has more time to screen<end>
<start>while protecting it<end>
<start>sunny the daron<end>
<start>even a supreme her seems impossible<end>
<start>he is too good<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewsasuke-gif-<end>
<start>and even with all its we have no proof that the authority of daeron really comes from its domain or from another aspectal capacity like sunny or nephis as you said above will return to integrate the opposing domains into a kind of collection that we will enlarge as we kill supremes it does not go at all because its will will against everything that we have shown until now has part probably to bite<end>
<start>you cannot get to know the rest of the work<end>
<start>and that it is at least a superior titan<end>
<start>mtn that he is knight they have no more reason to kill him<end>
<start>but the most complete yes<end>
<start>like in years they did not find any other supreme memory cheate or they did not find a transcendent fighting style<end>
<start>igris<end>
<start>nan and azy your steps funny dark sasuke<end>
<start>i am going full ss<end>
<start>and normally a daemon is not directly equivalent to a god in power<end>
<start>yeah it is when it is the end it is like saying there was a class after the divine it is not common<end>
<start>enough what is a divine aspect and here i will see it with a divine aspect like his brother<end>
<start>mdr nephis who hot his mother<end>
<start>he thought he was dead<end>
<start>it is too good<end>
<start>i think his expres because sunny is not the kind to fight at the front but i am sure her would have been good to see him a bit in trouble like in the hollow mountains seeing some clashes or even going to the shore sea forgets and fighting against titan superior her would have been fun to see<end>
<start>i will make the effort next time ahah<end>
<start>like a heritier's son swears fidelity to the parents of no groin<end>
<start>nan on the other hand i did not say it at the time because it seemed debile to me but would not the skin walker be the thief of the soul i do not know it seems to be pulling me by the hair but sunny says he also escaped from the tomb of the dread<end>
<start>of course<end>
<start>like the daeron vs a holy random is not possible<end>
<start>because reading this kind of thing about the mamamaaaaa flight<end>
<start>and that it was weird that it was passed on to the family after birth what mdr<end>
<start>pikawow the chapters on combat<end>
<start>he has an opportunity and powerful allies<end>
<start>i find that rain begins to have too much confidence in his body awakens especially in the<end>
<start>mwa i knew hehe<end>
<start>nan but there is a main characteristic and a secondary<end>
<start>it is based on the information we have<end>
<start>i do not like your nickname<end>
<start>to chap<end>
<start>yeah it is monstrous as a rhythm<end>
<start>he is really the cockroach he thinks he is being sunny<end>
<start>if they found a way not to enter through the wall it can be played<end>
<start>since i know that cassie knows the death of sunny in advance<end>
<start>well because that is his nephew they have a parent in common<end>
<start>i find that making them meet just like this would not have an ouf interest unless sunny said to nephis that he is the lord of shadows at that time<end>
<start>the most important thing is that you can continue even if we are late is that my opinion i know but if they accept having a fan-trad available it is the most important so as a personal reader i do not care and it is cool that you can continue it all the same<end>
<start>best thing that can happen<end>
<start>real ellipse of years sunny is not far from the stage of sovereign<end>
<start>if there is an ellipse do you think morgan will be a saint when the third nightmare returns<end>
<start>for government<end>
<start>aside from the one of brass he is in the bush<end>
<start>little shitapan goes<end>
<start>do not disco us high sovereign<end>
<start>on the other hand i still do not understand what caused nephis to die in the ring and why sunny has to pay attention to what he wants<end>
<start>who was masterful<end>
<start>i feel that the remaining chaps of the volume will turn my head<end>
<start>it depends how he got out of the tomb<end>
<start>they can read a trafficking<end>
<start>like if you do not have the loyalty card you cannot come back into the real world<end>
<start>they are amazing<end>
<start>so sunny did not kill the winter beast<end>
<start>it is probably the reason why the sunny of the future was sorry to be in the grave so he probably ripped off something important<end>
<start>i am currently in the chapter and a few i was wondering what is the strongest monster that sunny killed<end>
<start>i am going to<end>
<start>i thought that too<end>
<start>they must let pass that the awakens may<end>
<start>sunny towards the skin walkers<end>
<start>a little like their basic power left<end>
<start>to see things in the right rating x<end>
<start>i will try to find the chap or he gets the coat of lo terror<end>
<start>ah the technique to protect his soul<end>
<start>but fucking<end>
<start>it is always been the case for hop so it is been confirmed for a while<end>
<start>and what happens if he does<end>
<start>it is smart to flash back that way<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>i guess if he is back on the shore he is got revenge<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewomar-sy-france-bye-auvoir-gif-<end>
<start>ui<end>
<start>like she thinks it but she does not know the info vrmt and dcp would explain pk when we give her the info directly she forgets<end>
<start>weaver we do not know exactly<end>
<start>he has a vibe to him with the little time he has<end>
<start>and well i do not know<end>
<start>gray is getting married and having kids<end>
<start>someone would have the image of sunny during the same nightmare i find her more please<end>
<start>you need their permission but if you do not get a chance to break and take another bridge without them it is okay<end>
<start>why weaving and not<end>
<start>i do not think anyone's going to die in limmediat<end>
<start>i think gunlaug tabash anvil<end>
<start>if he is able to use all his clones as if it were him even<end>
<start>sah quel bg<end>
<start>ptdrrrr you see you are finally having a fun holiday<end>
<start>beautiful<end>
<start>always on top<end>
<start>yes yes it was in the choices laughs<end>
<start>so he was talking to him even if a little while when<end>
<start>after that may be the lord of shadows who will bastion and who meets sunny with nephis even if i do not see why it would happen<end>
<start>everything depends on what he wants to tell<end>
<start>yeah he cannot be natural but do not say he has to go in the pyramid<end>
<start>please<end>
<start>ha yes exact<end>
<start>cassia<end>
<start>and so far he is had a nightmare<end>
<start>you are not up to date<end>
<start>or the crown of dawn<end>
<start>other thing that makes bitrate hates his father<end>
<start>i just started reading before the announcement<end>
<start>i mean i think what is got a little idea of what is been done even though she does not realize how much impact it is had on sunny after leaving forget<end>
<start>but it is gone wrong for now<end>
<start>i had not even been careful i have to postpone to gray<end>
<start>or a catastrophe like the announcement of the appearance of a door of a level never seen in the real world<end>
<start>the ichor drop is something that the exitlege gives and transmits the lines<end>
<start>then he says what he wants<end>
<start>i was thinking<end>
<start>jsp c a divine memory his has no known limit sah<end>
<start>it is like a hole in their memory<end>
<start>but it does not necessarily fit in with the declaration of war<end>
<start>cassie she is planned until he or he is better not play chess with her<end>
<start>go<end>
<start>tamar who must not understand what is going on shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>after he was in a body awake<end>
<start>i have never started especially<end>
<start>that i have loved so much to learn<end>
<start>and sah what a madman's banker<end>
<start>we know this feeling so well<end>
<start>i said you should not be a generalite<end>
<start>it is true that these last days the chapters come out more about h when a week or two ago i think it would take a break after this volume<end>
<start>cassia she knows that sunny is a saint and that he has a divine aspect with its evolute appearance<end>
<start>can be hollow mountains<end>
<start>the cruel look she remembers when even sunny would have wide way to increase to transcendent rank i am sure<end>
<start>knowing that if you take only one element then there are many other characters who have only element related<end>
<start>i would theorize the grave of one of the members of the cohort<end>
<start>the beginning of the ma a little sour especially the part with the red packagee<end>
<start>this is in relation to the asterion of<end>
<start>take the role and ask readers there zero spoil there<end>
<start>you get eaten<end>
<start>yeah but i am thinking about the other god<end>
<start>you are talking about when<end>
<start>but how it is even possible that a sleeping capacity is able to deceive a saint<end>
<start>it seems to me it is a lot with the crazy prince if my memory is good mdrrrrr<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewreally-benjamin-lupo-drlupo-stare-are-you-sure-gif-<end>
<start>there is already too much stuff there<end>
<start>it is almost on real she will definitely have a very fine utilite to counter bitret shibalaugh<end>
<start>as he did with the little boy on the chap or<end>
<start>i did not start flying again<end>
<start>yes and he never succeeded<end>
<start>arc shopping with kai<end>
<start>the chapter that talks exactly about this do not we were talking about at the hour is dead<end>
<start>in nephi thoughts<end>
<start>anopers<end>
<start>i am too scared<end>
<start>that is the advantage i had of telling him about it first<end>
<start>i can get the chap number to see please<end>
<start>this weekend i catch up you are not worried<end>
<start>but i think<end>
<start>when i do not remember what he said<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewevil-evil-laugh-evil-racoon-hehehehe-muhahaha-gif-<end>
<start>theorise like me his fact passes the tps<end>
<start>after he says i look at your breasts<end>
<start>first withdrawal<end>
<start>it is going to pass the same nightmare without appearance the sovereigns they will not understand<end>
<start>oh the words<end>
<start>in banishment spoil i thought<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwake-up-meme-gif-<end>
<start>she says it is her way of apologizing<end>
<start>he was master before<end>
<start>like it bugs<end>
<start>yeah i remember more imagining it was another god who had repung<end>
<start>it would almost be worth the reset<end>
<start>that have known by hop that every daemon is the default of a god<end>
<start>pq oneshot ya something i forgot<end>
<start>the revelation of nephis sunny the revelation of cassie effie pregnant we had so much reversal of situation of the cohort in this arc third nightmare<end>
<start>she is been sent a ball<end>
<start>through his divinite flame it looks like<end>
<start>omg i am the goat actually<end>
<start>moreover someone has the g publication calendar to know the new rhythm<end>
<start>yes totally i slept<end>
<start>qqun has kai fanart in oshi no ko mode please<end>
<start>yeah sure<end>
<start>at our time when there were shadow creations in every corner of the street it had to be more convenient<end>
<start>but honestly it will surprise me<end>
<start>okay i was lying that in my head<end>
<start>rain that will receive a coat of armor sacre from sunny as a gift just in the case-or the end of the chapter made me burst with laughter sunny hat to see a triple fight between two avatar and master sunless<end>
<start>mordret is cooking shibalaugh<end>
<start>otherwise sunny could not control them they are at an unimaginable distance from one another<end>
<start>yo i wanted to ask you there will be a chapter translated tomorrow or not because i believe the author will not come out tomorrow if i understand<end>
<start>and then to return to your speech you present nephis as a noble character who wants to bring salvation to humanity while not at all<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmichael-jackson-eating-popcorn-enjoy-i-like-name-name-gif-<end>
<start>it is not going to be efficacious and her bebe either<end>
<start>so i was not refreshing my page like an asshole<end>
<start>damn it<end>
<start>yes<end>
<start>who thinks he kissed him for the supreme<end>
<start>gunlaug weaver<end>
<start>that is said or its by contrast<end>
<start>it seemed logical given all the clues before<end>
<start>and he told him you are going to regret it<end>
<start>nightmare's going to be so full of dreams of super-creatures it is going to be crazy<end>
<start>not exactly<end>
<start>better and better shadow slave i like<end>
<start>what<end>
<start>do not touch a sunny<end>
<start>how can you say his when asterion exists<end>
<start>to me it is just that cassie appeared before them in the nightmare<end>
<start>for me he killed daeron had the crown it is beaten with the force of dusk to activate the rage of the crown to kill nephis and activated the defense of dusk<end>
<start>and i think<end>
<start>what the hell is this banana cock on chap the catscreen<end>
<start>i was fucking with you<end>
<start>houla<end>
<start>oh non vrm the bounty of humor ds ss sa<end>
<start>he will type like a boar<end>
<start>effie<end>
<start>ok that is because i did not know if he had not done it because it is not necessarily easy to do or for some other reason i wanted to offer even though i had made it for my use<end>
<start>it is thanks to the multiple memory of sunless that she begins to make the rapprochement and especially thanks to her attribute which is related to<end>
<start>she does not receive memories and is neither appearance nor competence<end>
<start>yo guys jespere you are okay does anyone remember in which chapter sunny and nephis smells together and suddenly realize that their powers are complementary and can perfectly fit to boost each other if someone can help me with that it will be nice<end>
<start>thank you grayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy<end>
<start>when you see the guys he wants to hit he thinks they will be up to it<end>
<start>i do not care about you<end>
<start>it is true that it would be probable but i will find it wrong<end>
<start>yeah i would put a piece on it<end>
<start>i am not here anymore to break batman's balls<end>
<start>i am pretty much okay he does not have the lvl for solo a shibalaugh nightmare<end>
<start>he will always be able to accomplish the next level but he will not be able to have the reward that goes with just knowledge<end>
<start>good sunny is lucky to go crazy<end>
<start>perso weaving of the shadow makes me vibrate<end>
<start>since the beginning the sortlege stops calling sunny a traitor in the descriptions of different things you think it is because he abandoned the others at the end of the nightmares and the sortlege knew it or that it is about something else<end>
<start>ah no<end>
<start>ask yourself questions<end>
<start>factual<end>
<start>sunny who insults by conscience interposes it to me<end>
<start>if master sunless becomes a knight and drags with nephis and the keepers of fire there is way that he is brought to godgrave<end>
<start>like they are not raye from existence<end>
<start>it would be bcp more smart from sunny because otherwise the domain of the place it is it can more be moved nn<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrr he is crazy<end>
<start>even maybe the father of nephis was lenfous in history<end>
<start>if some people want to go vote biteret<end>
<start>i really do not understand<end>
<start>sunphis<end>
<start>he manages his work too well<end>
<start>so it allows them to control the sea lanes<end>
<start>tkt the same<end>
<start>off screen or just i do not remember<end>
<start>okay yeah<end>
<start>i think it was really the rdr who ate that part<end>
<start>i did not know it but it had to be qqch<end>
<start>on sunny it is just useless nan<end>
<start>sunny clones are too strong<end>
<start>especially for others<end>
<start>especially the basic team they have been through so much<end>
<start>if they come out of the tomb already<end>
<start>but pk x<end>
<start>after combat<end>
<start>who built the tomb<end>
<start>we do not know if the gods are godless or if they rose to that rank<end>
<start>in real life i do not think already anvil has an aspect that has left above all a utility creation of memory and that song it has let be especially to direct dead so probably not an individual power boost enormous<end>
<start>thank you for the chaps<end>
<start>nan really broke<end>
<start>that is what i do not understand<end>
<start>the question is how he brought nephis to remember him may be that he is going to make a counter to the estuary a memory that keeps the forget<end>
<start>and the sybil too i confess i did not see i am blind shibalaugh<end>
<start>the world is not ready for v bono nephis<end>
<start>and it highlights her madness<end>
<start>he was not necessarily transcendent<end>
<start>hesite not to join the g server even if they chap ahead there are crazy illustrious down<end>
<start>you quote since you put in between we can have the number of the chap stp<end>
<start>you finished the v<end>
<start>you did not understand what<end>
<start>nan but i just do not want snake to be the ultimate brazen buff and take it all off of his exploit it is a security okay but not that it is overheat so with sunny that rankup snake will probably be way too strong for his first nightmare<end>
<start>q something important in relation to<end>
<start>her mother directly<end>
<start>if that is really it he spent years in the nightmare shibalaugh<end>
<start>att i will see again i forgot<end>
<start>so it may bother some<end>
<start>it is impossible<end>
<start>but shadow recently appeared in the world of dreams<end>
<start>but we do not know if the fact of tp the temple goes to the domain<end>
<start>maree celete masterclass<end>
<start>which is for me the one who has the luckiest dead with cassia<end>
<start>on the other hand it will be difficult to see the lore on godgrave from the ruins of the cranes or even the rest<end>
<start>shibalaugh would have been well after the bow that probably ended in the next chapter<end>
<start>force to her husband<end>
<start>the cassie church will be founded sah how she carry i have not seen the last yet but it is suuur i will love it<end>
<start>i was so not kai becoming more than holy frankly<end>
<start>but with the mask he cannot say<end>
<start>tonight's chapter marks the end of the volume or not yet<end>
<start>ahutaoteeheepoint<end>
<start>not wrong by the way she is the only one who knew what sunny was going to face so maybe it helped<end>
<start>i thought he would have or easily turned away the truth<end>
<start>yeah but it is not really the same thing for me<end>
<start>always bars these chapters laugh her<end>
<start>the amount of spoil i ate on it<end>
<start>and i regret it<end>
<start>but to see<end>
<start>damage but understandable<end>
<start>what discussion<end>
<start>i think it says it is weaver's arm<end>
<start>with the neph domain that begins to appear<end>
<start>we find pieces of weaver heritage where it is passed ya brand line prohibited from weaver not of the god of dreams<end>
<start>tkt i know her but you will see her has her advantage too the you can do theory with who is up to date and in real life it is really fun to get the opinions of others<end>
<start>i will say not insensitive but more outside a bit like a bug if not every time sunny talks to someone this one will have to forget<end>
<start>except if it works that if you have to be in the nightmare or at least appear dumpling was only an embryo so maybe it was not considered a living being<end>
<start>like they need their permission psq they are the strongest and they decide but in reality they have no impact<end>
<start>do not laugh at me<end>
<start>he has strong teeth<end>
<start>but should be prepared<end>
<start>colonel chabert<end>
<start>you hope for all the readers<end>
<start>it is purely theoretical in itself but there is no other case in the<end>
<start>but i would eat them in j again<end>
<start>but i think he is getting pretty well by giving himself a lot<end>
<start>they make a child just before going to the war that is likely to go in balls in the middle<end>
<start>it would be so good a good pov rain cbpray<end>
<start>it is when even intriguing asterion<end>
<start>he will have to answer yes<end>
<start>it is your first novel<end>
<start>the sunny must have understood that it was a concept and we too in the same way<end>
<start>but mecccccccc<end>
<start>nan stormsea it was subnautica already i think<end>
<start>now that i am totally up to date i am going to let nothing go and that is what is going to happen if some people talk about your patience has limits<end>
<start>yeah that is very accurate<end>
<start>i did not understand the not the same way but apparently yes at once<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewuhh-gif-<end>
<start>they are still incredibly funny<end>
<start>at the end jet will become a shadow she will need more to kill because sunny will find something to get her gasoline<end>
<start>how she should enjoy herself<end>
<start>i am sure they do not really have a connection but he sees that they go together<end>
<start>yeah it is a little bit earlier but it is in the chaps after the end of the volume chained breaker<end>
<start>i would replace am with just p<end>
<start>this is what we expect from a lost light<end>
<start>it is even more a shadow it is a clone transcendent in case she has a problem<end>
<start>okay but i still do not understand why he needs it<end>
<start>maybe when she is a divine titan shibalaugh<end>
<start>with asterion<end>
<start>you killed a bully wakes<end>
<start>it can store an infinite amount of shadow<end>
<start>yes and yen is not too much<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewrobert-downey-jr-tony-stark-gif-<end>
<start>either he is going to tell her and she thinks he is still talking bullshit or he is not going to tell her i think<end>
<start>bah continues<end>
<start>after the last time i got carried away i did not go far from the ban but it was a night of madness<end>
<start>maybe he is between life and death and he prepares a respectable<end>
<start>so the real sunny and the sunny nightmare can meet<end>
<start>he created a church<end>
<start>i panicked<end>
<start>weaver did not happen again we ate her posthumously<end>
<start>in the church with effiy<end>
<start>but in this case anvil is aware that there is a guy that the cohort has forgotten<end>
<start>i miss wut<end>
<start>funny to see the rest<end>
<start>and the only one who would be indifferent to that<end>
<start>it is probably funny but flumsy to translate shibalaugh<end>
<start>if your own version of the future tells you to go and you go when you go<end>
<start>laugh nephis<end>
<start>cassie thought sunny was going to kill neph<end>
<start>you are back<end>
<start>i am talking about vision after the nightmares that would have had before sunny was free<end>
<start>for example in my opinion the field of cassia if it has one it has an attraction either to destiny or knowledge whereas nephis it is the cyou are so finally both can coexist yen will just a weaker<end>
<start>poto i am on the mwa leash outside your debates and theories cbcattochristian<end>
<start>but it will hurt me especially because of what he said in the chaps<end>
<start>plus with tamar she is not going to have any problems if we figure out what and not infected by the sortlege<end>
<start>but in sah cassia the goat just actually<end>
<start>no idea meh<end>
<start>oh no no no no<end>
<start>new character will see no harm<end>
<start>that is when even a big step up shibalaugh<end>
<start>after g the mad prince was even more advanced in the dance of the shadow than the current sunny gives you an idea of the monster it was<end>
<start>and so far from ellipse it is pretty much gone well<end>
<start>the closer we get to the status of god or at least to the divine rank and therefore the lines are becoming more and more logically awakened so it could be linked and bring us information and since they would be stronger there is also the odds of gaining access to more region of the dream kingdom so more exploration and more information findable as sunny currently on the forgotten shore or in the tower of ebene with the runes that nether has left<end>
<start>since we know that sunny and nephis will become great sovereign minimum<end>
<start>ah gg<end>
<start>ah the prince of the nightmare<end>
<start>i know<end>
<start>sunny is not the only one to see these sons<end>
<start>especially what told him not to go to the estuary<end>
<start>never<end>
<start>and we do not know his name anymore<end>
<start>no but what to say is like he did with that song he is ready to serve her to kill anvil or we do not know what he wants after and we know that that song will die afterwards so<end>
<start>when i said big it is on the intense level but my question is your favorite volume of work or just among the volumes a little lighter than the others<end>
<start>okay<end>
<start>for me be he is on the moon to do research on the first door be look for a level door to pass sacre as enounced before be to encompass the moon in his domain i admit not even another reason that would push him to go down<end>
<start>be they leap in time of years<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewhairraising-goosepimples-gif-<end>
<start>always less good than rock<end>
<start>in truth all volumes apart the first how by chapter of intro a little slow<end>
<start>i do not think that is what fate sees and that it is still at last perhaps more than mtn<end>
<start>in real life the impossible to know<end>
<start>the prince of the sun<end>
<start>of what i understood of the chap if they fight in a nightmare and nightmare wins it a nightmare if during all its battles the enemy's soul lache has a moment he dies in real life nightmare earns fragments<end>
<start>he is what now tyrant ascendant<end>
<start>we should have put them before if we wanted to have povs of the fight but good fights against a horde of creation of the nightmare we already had on the shore forget so i do not necessarily interest<end>
<start>the whole story<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>it is widely possible to see probable<end>
<start>like it is the two he will not kill<end>
<start>psq neph aims to overwhelm the domain of sovereigns<end>
<start>then we can already imagine the level of knowledge about the witchcraft of mortret<end>
<start>she did not throw it away but she does not care what happens to sunny as long as it is useful to her<end>
<start>yen a not bcp that have divine aspects must not compare<end>
<start>failed<end>
<start>this end that i suppose to be the dananke ketch yes his doing week i force with his<end>
<start>we remember people think caster sacrificed himself to save nephis ptdrrrr<end>
<start>they can feel it intuitively so it suffixes over time<end>
<start>it is literally v<end>
<start>not necessarily in his entourage what<end>
<start>stronger than today's sunny is on<end>
<start>we must not forget that the sovereigns are the elite of the elite of the awakenings<end>
<start>it is possible that its hard years as a week<end>
<start>nan ss is the high level<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewi do not know-i-do not-know-unsure-spongebob-friendsary-gif-<end>
<start>then we did not really see any sunny fight<end>
<start>cassie can see attribute aspects etc but not the enchantment of memories<end>
<start>kai<end>
<start>in addition the chapters the mm if cassia tries to redeem herself she does not deserve forgiveness<end>
<start>he is going to work out in a very long time normally<end>
<start>normally yeah considering that power is from its aspect<end>
<start>ah but that song and anvil do not have incredible aspects i think<end>
<start>we do not know yet but it is also one of the theories that comes back the most<end>
<start>chp<end>
<start>that is especially realistic i find mdr<end>
<start>a little bit of his treatment i expected a lot from him<end>
<start>and they had children<end>
<start>my bad i thought it was efficacious<end>
<start>ahutaopanik<end>
<start>well the dream kingdom is the real world x<end>
<start>we cannot be blind anymore is crazy<end>
<start>it is her<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>he cane sunny already loses his weapon that rises in power with him he probably has a very important connection with death so do not<end>
<start>finally g make pov other characters and give them real power up<end>
<start>on the other hand i wonder sunny says that he was shocked to feel again the shadows of people and the noise when he came back from the dream kingdom to go to the real world but at the same time he has a shadow that watches over the groove for a while he says it at the moment or he has had his transfo his shadows cannot speak when he does not directly control them so he should have felt the shadows around him i find it incoherent that his clone when he took control of it did not have the same pb that sunny is not accustomed to the noise and shadows of the humans one of them otherwise his may want to say that his clone did not have the sense of shadow when he is in it but even this theory does not work because he would have heard the noise of the people around him in the cases be that it is an incoherence be that i misunderstood if anyone can explain in this case the hot jseus<end>
<start>in real life it would be so cool that rain would join the cohort of tamar after his ass<end>
<start>sunny falling back into her v-cross<end>
<start>it has no interest<end>
<start>i was thinking too much of the dead stuff in jjk<end>
<start>in the end i was wrong it is really available on amazon<end>
<start>the last is the god of dreams no<end>
<start>but what part of the sortlege would be under the influence of the god forgets<end>
<start>the months i started out i had an annihilated the social life that i had<end>
<start>and that the first infected came from lunar colonies<end>
<start>okay and her ability was up after the same nightmare so you think that is what information sees more now<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>it is something that is troubling me in my head<end>
<start>if he possessed a sovereign he did not take back his domain at least as long as he was a saint<end>
<start>and complained as always about the work he had to do in the shadows<end>
<start>the ancients know the terror of sunny reverenced from a blue sky without limit<end>
<start>therefore necessary<end>
<start>not if her nightmare starts<end>
<start>it is almost nothing more you have to wait for tuesday pro i will probably post them at h of the most boring mat it is going to be to mold the impatient readers who will come with their comment on the chapters of vo<end>
<start>it contrasts so much with their basic personality that it becomes comical<end>
<start>not just at the beginning when they find her<end>
<start>it must be so loud that this guy<end>
<start>big is crazy<end>
<start>this is due to the estuary anomaly<end>
<start>the volcano<end>
<start>for me the exit and fate c not the same<end>
<start>chair of shadow eme all hail the shadow flesh<end>
<start>when sunny came back into the world of dreams in the year she had to do something<end>
<start>so either it is the original owner who decides or it is the groin<end>
<start>it is true that at present i think the winter bete it fedroye<end>
<start>or she is not very lucky to hurt him<end>
<start>but she is not honest with him and then i do not really accept the shore blow forget and do not make any excuses no the bottle does not matter if he is not aware of this do not she apologizes it is no use<end>
<start>there was also a tyrant or a cursed terror with but good shibalaugh<end>
<start>she just knows when her parents will die<end>
<start>the crazy chaps they are in a shitty creek her<end>
<start>at worst<end>
<start>vsy at worst i bet on chapters<end>
<start>at least at the time<end>
<start>jsp if sunny will keep her out of the exit leg she can almost never advance otherwise<end>
<start>because technically every person is a part of the domain<end>
<start>we call it the corrupt sunny<end>
<start>it is a question i ask myself<end>
<start>att i am trying to find the extract ct vrmt at the beginning of the flight<end>
<start>thanks for the chap gray<end>
<start>oh the flight's over<end>
<start>today's sunny no longer has the exit leg and it does not bother him so much<end>
<start>if for example in the future he interacts with a member of the cohort<end>
<start>sunny says he would have been uncomfortable if neph's fake father lived with him because he is busy<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewleonardo-dicaprio-clapping-clap-applause-amazing-gif-<end>
<start>as it is free a lot voluntarily forgets illegalite i imagine ptdrrrr<end>
<start>ita of the flight a max<end>
<start>nephis you are not going to stab me in the back sunny not the rest balec but just that on the other hand shibalaugh<end>
<start>i hope we are going to have pov switches like sunny and nephis<end>
<start>but it does not have a utilite in combat like an echo<end>
<start>because it has powers that look like asterion and we see it with valor we can define the aspect that qqun will have<end>
<start>yes<end>
<start>but at the same time you have never seen a monster with luciditis so it is complicated to say<end>
<start>if<end>
<start>the poor<end>
<start>pipu is transcendent too<end>
<start>it was haunted so there is doubt but it is possible<end>
<start>auft la daronne c'est une random<end>
<start>well it looks like mdrr<end>
<start>more than chapters before the end of the volume<end>
<start>the song is terrifying<end>
<start>i swear to you i see too much effie die<end>
<start>we will never learn from our mistakes mdrg it is a sadistic fucking genius<end>
<start>what can kill snake honestly<end>
<start>so i confess you are stopping a dcp glue<end>
<start>either they are home after<end>
<start>let us see if my post v receipt is passed and that g successfully made me appreciate ss<end>
<start>i think this is a domain theft and it would be too stylish<end>
<start>you can talk about all the chaps fr de gray<end>
<start>or the trunk of sunny because do not forget it is a shadow too<end>
<start>but the actual flight has left really dantesque<end>
<start>anyhow he has more time before the war<end>
<start>we have to stop inventing stuff when it is written<end>
<start>they are really bound by fate these two the<end>
<start>a merchant has more his place in stormsea with the house of the night than in the mountains of serious god with warriors of elite<end>
<start>and if<end>
<start>i strongly believe that one day he can weave sons of fate<end>
<start>maybe it is more<end>
<start>in the temple<end>
<start>then what has manipulated fate and risked his life dozens of times to offer him the opportunity to free himself<end>
<start>i do not have to but it makes me laugh<end>
<start>no it is just that i am the author's release and unfortunately it is the<end>
<start>i love the ambiance rooms that there is right now in the chapters especially the last<end>
<start>and tbates a more classical length it is pages so i think chap ss chap roman<end>
<start>ptdr it is that same<end>
<start>sunny is free from destiny and can change it<end>
<start>as the devil of the antarctic<end>
<start>and as jet is nice they are on good terms<end>
<start>are they back in the circle<end>
<start>here is the most basic application<end>
<start>yes<end>
<start>on the other hand with this chapter we see the immeasurable power of a domain<end>
<start>serious far serious far still only week mdr<end>
<start>i was going to bring it back too<end>
<start>i think we should wait again for chapters to continue<end>
<start>it would make it feel like g did spawn just like ca xsd<end>
<start>well if we start from the principle that time is spent outside she is been infected<end>
<start>and now all he does with it is shadow is trancending so good<end>
<start>the information really is strong<end>
<start>but it is definitely in the best<end>
<start>nan since the blade of people dies so all these bodies are a bit of a bit of a bit<end>
<start>all enchantments<end>
<start>i do not know if naeve said the black sea was a corrupt or a superior<end>
<start>the volume just ended with the chapters that the author published today<end>
<start>apart from forgetfulness<end>
<start>dread night is antartic center that is it<end>
<start>have to see the roll<end>
<start>i really hope she is going to get it<end>
<start>i say sunny is afraid of that<end>
<start>i thought i would come back from the goat bite but that is when it is even cool<end>
<start>we do not see enough the impact of the loss of the exit leg<end>
<start>i will not say anything more<end>
<start>o a good idea if you want to go to the next bbq in the cohort<end>
<start>so back to the pyramid<end>
<start>o but before he was sealed he separated<end>
<start>mdrr honestly every chapter from the shore forgets i tell myself it will not be better<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>it is like biting<end>
<start>if he is gone out as a beast he does not have to be terror or titan yet<end>
<start>in full arc center antartic volume there is chapter that shows cassia has her birthday with her mother who explains that she knows the death of her father her mother and of sunny<end>
<start>y'a pdv opposing the theory level<end>
<start>ah yeah last<end>
<start>pq threatens it like that<end>
<start>so i read<end>
<start>it is the most mysterious in tt case and often mystere rhymes with force so yeah to see<end>
<start>worse than gods worse than daemons<end>
<start>i read webtoon image version<end>
<start>some person the transfo is a concept while other is a creation or even a nude of creation i remember more if there is an idea of concept but his was quoted once i believe<end>
<start>bah it with lellipse is the best time to stop<end>
<start>yep the whole volume until the last chapter i would say<end>
<start>it is getting crazy<end>
<start>a shadow that speaks you do not take a lot of risks<end>
<start>by separating deamons<end>
<start>we saw how the cohort became corrupt once<end>
<start>except you<end>
<start>on the other hand the way do not the transition was made between the sunny i find it really style<end>
<start>anyway it sucks to try to measure people's qi it is useless<end>
<start>so i think that sunny has melted with holy fielon nightmare wins<end>
<start>he will definitely take the opportunity<end>
<start>it is the best volume of the work you will enjoy<end>
<start>i know i left several times<end>
<start>and well just like every shadow is bound to a core i am not on<end>
<start>the cohort will be able to continue to move quietly as mtn<end>
<start>he killed the mother of nephis almost on who was a master and became hollow<end>
<start>passages on the black turtle wtf<end>
<start>but dcp when sunny says it directly she forgets it but when she understands it alone she retains it a bit bizzar when even but if understanding remains indirect her nen remains the understanding of who is sunny what is contrary to the lack of destiny he has<end>
<start>i remember a description of the kind<end>
<start>cassie will give us a little depression<end>
<start>what grave the tomb of ariel you are or<end>
<start>ahhhh<end>
<start>a little bit<end>
<start>there must be a few chapters before the end of the date there is a way to have the declaration<end>
<start>i am going to squeeze in front<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthe-universe-tim-and-eric-mind-blown-mind-blown-me-mind-explosion-mind-explosion-meme-gif-<end>
<start>then it is not impossible<end>
<start>it is totally positive in case fildrong c is a goatesque bg<end>
<start>stopping<end>
<start>exactly i see the sunny shadows like igrisberu etc ahah<end>
<start>it is one of their passes that did not succeed to go to the estuary which is also the source<end>
<start>he is the most dangerous character for clans<end>
<start>naf<end>
<start>and also what fun when nephis partially understands who is sunny<end>
<start>sure<end>
<start>so he will not embarrass a valor when he goes out with nephis<end>
<start>when you have interaction with no one he does not change much his default<end>
<start>she was not aware that someone would stop her from passing holy '<end>
<start>it is done me twice<end>
<start>i understand better why she is distant<end>
<start>he was throwing so badly<end>
<start>sunny had a first ireel nightmare that is why he had his divine attribute<end>
<start>exactly what i had hoped for above<end>
<start>yeah go go go<end>
<start>that means yes hard breakie<end>
<start>i do not agree with you and i would not change my mind so it is useless to keep fighting<end>
<start>and holy it washes<end>
<start>she is going to try at a distance but yeah it is going to end up in the body<end>
<start>nope<end>
<start>a horror arch with lo<end>
<start>the most shocking thing is that the lord of shadows has worn an apron and prepared him with delicious waffles with a ball of ice and fresh strawberries over shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>it is not just that she saw her anniv hanging out so she wants her to be weird<end>
<start>ah pck we are buddies mtn<end>
<start>he won psq he is a madman and that just points out his strange appearance saying that the loss is weak is wrong since he is going to have a lot more trouble moving forward without the exit leg and he is lost a lot of memories<end>
<start>oh yeah i just picked up<end>
<start>mdr but it is serious possible in sah<end>
<start>noctis le goat<end>
<start>the simultaneous avatars coast is nice that if we have the right to a pov sunny differentententent who interchange it can be really cool<end>
<start>i hope that the entire antarctic band will agree to join the shadow clan if ever sunny asks them<end>
<start>you think he can make yai sunny jump on you at the same time with the shadow manifestation and everything<end>
<start>jme mal expresse jvolais say irreel in the exceptional sense not in the non real sense yes jsuis un idiot<end>
<start>i have chills<end>
<start>also yeah<end>
<start>and they are finally really an actor in history<end>
<start>we are all right<end>
<start>yeah the same way i have never finished orv will have to put me on one day<end>
<start>too strong<end>
<start>jsp why i felt it said somewhere<end>
<start>uh<end>
<start>lalchimist<end>
<start>for a dream of sunny jcrois<end>
<start>and with a divine who fights directly he would have won rather easily<end>
<start>must consider the utility of the characters<end>
<start>it is almost all the symptoms<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfma-roy-mustang-mustang-roy-sad-gif-<end>
<start>that his domain is deplacable<end>
<start>moreover if the goal of cassia was really to help sunny why not talk to him about it before he would have fortarily been leaving<end>
<start>so would activate the easy mode' for me it does not work too much it is the reverse<end>
<start>psq it is really excellent from the first chapter to the last<end>
<start>but if yen had to pass it would be fielon<end>
<start>thanks the goat<end>
<start>tell me what you think<end>
<start>by contrast<end>
<start>changes are logical<end>
<start>yep that is basically in the first nightmare only the shadow has resonated to the call of sunny among all the gods<end>
<start>bah in chap ya rain who woke up sunny and neph who kissed each other<end>
<start>i admit he is beautiful<end>
<start>i do not know how it worked but in the city of daeron he could be in a city fold<end>
<start>without necessarily being<end>
<start>at the beginning of chap<end>
<start>prince of persia<end>
<start>or something a little more likely<end>
<start>i am feeling that rain has recovered the destiny attribute of sunny shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>i do not think the crazy prince is talking to his future<end>
<start>it is for sure that when your only picture of butterflies is ten-man monsters putting up with the huge claws that want to kill you shibalaugh<end>
<start>it is good to see her more responsible<end>
<start>a holy walk like a bridge<end>
<start>especially that the snake should include the difficulty of the nightmare not<end>
<start>so it speedrun<end>
<start>he can always recover the nightmare<end>
<start>when even a difference between a divine and a supreme<end>
<start>bones of the ariel legend in a whisper<end>
<start>well that sounds logical it allows people to wake up much easier i am not saying that is the final reason but that is probably the direct reason<end>
<start>may be the source of his domain<end>
<start>and the beginning of t<end>
<start>i think they are going to appear at the same time as in between<end>
<start>so so to be able to bind sunny the merchant and sunny wakes up from the shore forgets etc it is the daemon of forgetfulness the biggest problem<end>
<start>once you get out of the first nightmare you wait for the winter solstice and at this moment yours again sends into the dream realm not a nightmare this time and you have to get out of it<end>
<start>type me stuv x<end>
<start>it is less solo leveling<end>
<start>volume or<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewdcani-rcaalitca-gauchisme-conversano-cacher-gif-<end>
<start>yeah overall<end>
<start>after the sky snow sand sea now jungle<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>because without agreement writes the word is worth nothing<end>
<start>see how he is going to figure it out<end>
<start>full night white to theorise<end>
<start>but what the fuck<end>
<start>he is been alone in a cave for years<end>
<start>hutaogasp<end>
<start>he wanted his line i think<end>
<start>it is for lore no big crazy<end>
<start>oe but dark sunny may have traded even more by playing with the estuary<end>
<start>it is the worst thing ever<end>
<start>while fielon is the best<end>
<start>on the god forget<end>
<start>oh go ahead<end>
<start>there must be no avatar to bite<end>
<start>if the exit leg has nothing to do with the doors<end>
<start>a little runaway that everyone forgets it but in mm time hype by the lonely sunny and i also hate to see the next flashback on the years solo<end>
<start>it is so strong<end>
<start>and when you try to remember that blur it does not work<end>
<start>then we are<end>
<start>but naaannn reddox finally ohv<end>
<start>after me there is no wonder that he kills a cursed creature knowing that he is used to killing two-row superimposed creatures in his general way he does it after being well-rounded<end>
<start>i will remove it quickly<end>
<start>the crazy chaps thanks gray<end>
<start>i will probably ask you about my advisor for other work if you know it well<end>
<start>bah nephis<end>
<start>at the beginning volume it was said that the sovereigns allowed on the infective and that mm if they have the seed of the nightmare in them it does not slam until the sovereign of the domain decides it<end>
<start>but really just i am going to end volume sunny that vs hundreds of creatures they are too strong<end>
<start>when you have a machine that has wished in your story i think it is not interesting to do what the world is waiting for you to do<end>
<start>he came for what<end>
<start>okay mrc<end>
<start>nan would not have to die either but simply that it does not nerve the potential of groove<end>
<start>i said stv<end>
<start>the day he meets the world in particular<end>
<start>i think about it before sunny<end>
<start>is what i am g<end>
<start>i do not see her in that sense anymore<end>
<start>show respect on the winter beast when even<end>
<start>chap appearance of goliath i did not find nn plus<end>
<start>so it is definitely a masterclass<end>
<start>who will make him read to another guy<end>
<start>yes they start the volume the volume ends in the chapter of the shot still a little patience will arrive quickly for you emiliahappy<end>
<start>the lamp<end>
<start>of bitten<end>
<start>said when<end>
<start>but i do not think there is any logic to do it<end>
<start>i am thinking right now of my choice in order is volume volume volume i am waiting to finish it to know ahah<end>
<start>he should have made shadow slave book like his would not have started with a volume we cannot get past the figure laughs<end>
<start>the only<end>
<start>for the time skip it probably explains<end>
<start>nan it has a really rudimentary version<end>
<start>and then with what anemone said that the real world was going to be absorbed by the dream kingdom it would be dangerous to arrive at the beginning of this<end>
<start>vasy better x<end>
<start>i forgot something i think<end>
<start>after have really little information about the different lines we will probably see when we get information about asterion<end>
<start>in battle has died i speak<end>
<start>- will have<end>
<start>acbpepewalkaway<end>
<start>while waiting bono our church has never done so well a queen in what she does i am very happy in everything i have made up<end>
<start>bah after each one imagines things differently this is what is good with reading<end>
<start>clearly the volume is incredible for her i remember all the crane pains that i had to make theory for everything and anything<end>
<start>in real life i advise<end>
<start>i am going to read in words if qqun wants to come<end>
<start>she forgot all that is related to the old sunless and the grace of memory she could guess who hardly was sunny if he had shown her memories of the past she would have forgotten<end>
<start>noctis did not say the moon's deesse was her big mother<end>
<start>mr for the chaps the memory fragment it was not small<end>
<start>my brain's already in ebullition<end>
<start>but despite the work we provide we must not forget because sometimes i feel that some forget what we do is totally illegal<end>
<start>just all the events in which he participated<end>
<start>it is reddox meh<end>
<start>this is the kingdom of dreams<end>
<start>let us go<end>
<start>if not why would they forget again with every mention of the old sunny<end>
<start>i do not even know if she will get infected with the exit leg if she does not go through the nightmare<end>
<start>it is mostly a lot of stuff so it got me wrong<end>
<start>or she will just become a normal wake<end>
<start>wait but there is only one chapter that came out today we are not in trouble<end>
<start>like you said they did not get into the grane<end>
<start>so it is cool neave is not dead<end>
<start>sunny has already explained some of the possibilities at this time<end>
<start>a few months at most in history<end>
<start>it is one of the theories coming back<end>
<start>vo<end>
<start>but i know what i was wondering if the citadels came from the sortlege<end>
<start>a beast superior even destructs a titan dormant<end>
<start>not bad for a mortal<end>
<start>aie aie aie<end>
<start>i feel the headache for some laughs<end>
<start>the beginning of the volume is great<end>
<start>i do not know if they lost their author or if we thought he was not very important or something<end>
<start>guys i cannot figure out the connection between sunny and the crazy prince<end>
<start>someone said it here in addition<end>
<start>the com of a certain aza<end>
<start>good sad news but simpa on their part to let you continue to trad when even chapter late but well you said it was webnovel it would have been more violent<end>
<start>really hateful comments under the chapters of ss they make crazy ptdrrrr<end>
<start>there are two possibilities either an illusion or the rdr is absorbing the earth<end>
<start>yeah but the sunny shop has not disappeared<end>
<start>must know how to make sacrifices to share this beautiful work<end>
<start>but it would be weird why come back only now<end>
<start>that is explained chapter after normal<end>
<start>he stole a he had weaver when he was<end>
<start>just her relationship with nephis going back<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewouter-wilds-gif-<end>
<start>it is not just because of its erasure of destiny they should be able to make the connection but if the other piaf has some bits of power of the demon of oblivion that would explain everything<end>
<start>i read both<end>
<start>yet it is more in these memories i feel<end>
<start>a variable that can change everything<end>
<start>we knew it already euredyce something like that sang it when we followed nephis<end>
<start>ah but i will believe it because it is crazy<end>
<start>ahah yes big positive point that on the other hand<end>
<start>not to mention the patches that have pedo delires with groove<end>
<start>on ss yes as the rhythm is daily it changes nothing you come back to the same<end>
<start>in any case he must be very strong this person<end>
<start>it will really weaver is supposed to be the only one who had a line because it does not really wean but lost nether would not really have had one<end>
<start>since the bird thief will probably matter later<end>
<start>i would say hollow mountains more<end>
<start>it is just crazy<end>
<start>yeah that is weird<end>
<start>and thank you for the chaps<end>
<start>i hate for the next chapters of tonight thanks gray for the gigantic taff<end>
<start>but you are crazy shibalaugh<end>
<start>the next will be very interesting<end>
<start>really crazy right now<end>
<start>yep i have completely zapped this point but agree on it<end>
<start>if it is not useful to the story later we will never know and it will mean that they have really learned useful things in their nightmare<end>
<start>lach what<end>
<start>wait for you to read the last chapters that come out every day or wait for you<end>
<start>if you wake up<end>
<start>you think that sunny will present himself under his real identity or he will take an alias for example with his mask to redo a mongrel<end>
<start>he is the god of destiny after all he is supposed to know everything no<end>
<start>ah in years then<end>
<start>well because they are the ones who regulate the interesexit<end>
<start>i hope he joins the night house mdr<end>
<start>cassie the best<end>
<start>good bah more than has read chapters now<end>
<start>chicken<end>
<start>makes it read all the works of the serv<end>
<start>thank you gray<end>
<start>okay maybe i am superhyp and that is my pref volume i do not know<end>
<start>but even nephis is even more powerful than sunny<end>
<start>yes it is bcp too simple<end>
<start>i maintain that he has no line<end>
<start>what a pleasure<end>
<start>gray by pitie tell me we can pin this valve please it is just perfect<end>
<start>test<end>
<start>it is the volume<end>
<start>you will see for yourself<end>
<start>same base his soul was really powerful<end>
<start>httpsyoutubevsezxqsivmmvgnnui<end>
<start>i need the sovereign's permission for this i agree with you<end>
<start>winter beast<end>
<start>pcq i had seen that there were new rules i would like to know what i can say<end>
<start>when even a lot of action i find<end>
<start>bah or is the problem<end>
<start>i guess sunny will be holy but well i may be a little quick<end>
<start>i wonder if it is a creation of the ultra powerful nightmare or whether it has anything to do with the sun god<end>
<start>theory on the nature of fog<end>
<start>yeah sure i am not saying the opposite<end>
<start>oe shibalaugh<end>
<start>reel jsuis hype died by this<end>
<start>ss<end>
<start>although we do not talk about it enough that fielon it is superior<end>
<start>uh not wrong<end>
<start>or it does not use its cores but to remember it was a simple beast at that time<end>
<start>since we saw that future sunny is not happy with her situation<end>
<start>i confess i still have trouble with the default of sunny<end>
<start>it is better to watch a football game with a lot of ass and a file on his seat than to look at him in the rain when he is cold with his ass in his ass<end>
<start>att<end>
<start>if sunny comes out mtn rain will piss a cable to know he did not do anything shibalaugh<end>
<start>possible that it is a ship to weaver also knowing that an ancient theory to me was that sunny had personally chosen by weaver to be the heritary of destiny thanks to the exit lege a beccause of his ancient attribute destiny that could have been a brand of weaver himself to make sure that he accesses his line the sinny frerot did not stop finding it and we recall that it is a line of a daemon so not a thing that we find all the corners of the street and we know nothing of the shadow the god and weaver perhaps that they have combined etc there are so many holes possible as it lacks bcp of information<end>
<start>guys i am late chap vs think that jlis tt right now or better than i let go in qq day<end>
<start>you see it is a bit of a match<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>like on the ro with neph making the appat<end>
<start>not yet chap la<end>
<start>watch out or we will send morgan to kill your guy<end>
<start>yep i know but even i am really on my hunger and i am not satisfied with the banana this volume was<end>
<start>more strengthening of all capa<end>
<start>there is a problem in yourself that you are saying it is true that efficate now she is not going to fight head down like before but we see that she does not hesitate to fight and see how she fights with jet and kai it is sure that it is very often being sent to the front together without counting the times or they would be alone in addition they are that holy to the government you said i do not see why they would send that jet to the point of creating a break in their experience and number of memories and even if the others are jet liaison agents made of administrative and has its place in the decision-making of the government i do not know why she will have more free time than the others<end>
<start>she does not know there is a madman hanging in there<end>
<start>wow<end>
<start>it does not psq it is not necessarily profitable depending on the situations it has not necessarily needed for the moment<end>
<start>i do not understand how you can blame it for a breakie when that asshole of sunny went there while he even in the future who made that choice told him no<end>
<start>the chapters of ss i would say pages they are very course<end>
<start>then it does not matter<end>
<start>but i have the impression c of the message code her<end>
<start>but it is not crazy<end>
<start>i wake up there messages here and it talks about asterion and furry<end>
<start>after sunny may be going back to the tomb to try to find her destiny<end>
<start>i mean i do not think so but maybe it is when they even guess about them that they do not forget like like as a cassie<end>
<start>mordret divine aspect<end>
<start>like it drives crazy<end>
<start>to whom he does reference<end>
<start>the nephis theory was interesting she just could not imagine that only one man could do anything a clan would do<end>
<start>you combine both<end>
<start>yeah real<end>
<start>olala her fate chapters in advance breathing noise<end>
<start>masterclass thank you gray you are hot<end>
<start>it is theory here<end>
<start>one month's vacation to read runes<end>
<start>he is probably just the most special in the genre<end>
<start>chap d'ajd<end>
<start>ct me<end>
<start>p-e that he has found qql thing to ink again without having a real name<end>
<start>masterclass<end>
<start>if i had to count<end>
<start>i hope we arrive soon at the dream of sunny<end>
<start>she apologized when they came out of the tree<end>
<start>but i am coming back<end>
<start>at least not very long<end>
<start>most versatile all-time novel<end>
<start>he had recyou a taste of ichor which was supposed to give him access to the line of the shadow but she was devoured by the line of weaver<end>
<start>we will see<end>
<start>i did not get it<end>
<start>chapter v<end>
<start>i am not laughing either<end>
<start>his intention was to go to the estuary<end>
<start>and i am sorry it was not my intention<end>
<start>that is when he picked it up<end>
<start>it is even worse than i thought<end>
<start>no access to the exit leg<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrr jme am ptet it is an important thing but not the beginning of the chapter i could scream<end>
<start>but waits he was in the cohort his fact if we do not expect sunny so he can theoretically have one of those clones with every member of the cohort and do what he wants<end>
<start>i have other questions but i would ask them tonight i have class ptdr<end>
<start>i will have to reread it in webnovel<end>
<start>you are talking about his fault<end>
<start>probably to make the link in francais i suppose<end>
<start>oh yeah you think i understand in real life but as ananke said if something exists its opposite also must exist<end>
<start>mordret is currently looking for his charism after his fight against sunny<end>
<start>it is true even if we do not know the nephis and biter that i think is of a particular kind too<end>
<start>my superior<end>
<start>yes and<end>
<start>to lepoque the exitlege did not send people into nightmares<end>
<start>manifestation of vacuum<end>
<start>it is been a year huh<end>
<start>mouahahahahahaha<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewleon-marchand-paris-paris--olympic-games-games-olympic-gif-<end>
<start>besides sunny he has a giga malus on his collection of fragments he must have an advantage like nuclei unlimited or from the eme an infinite space<end>
<start>even if it is perhaps to protect his line to have the appearance of a divine<end>
<start>chap sunny is with nephis and they face scavengers<end>
<start>how his mask says something to neph<end>
<start>yes and nothing says what line of that song i think i forgot which one it is<end>
<start>depending on how it is done<end>
<start>i am waiting for this to happen<end>
<start>and sunny probably an airaigne in real life<end>
<start>it is just me i cannot read braille too derrickthinking<end>
<start>seeing what told him not to go<end>
<start>and bite in holy it is scary<end>
<start>is that all that exists and is bound to sunny before the tomb is directly forgotten<end>
<start>all the questions you will have you will find them as you read<end>
<start>the sortlege is one of those fans<end>
<start>ananke explained<end>
<start>as long as you join the cc cassie<end>
<start>it just seemed to me that each part corresponded to a daemon to the estuary it is the part of the daemon of oblivion a possible bastion of imagination etc<end>
<start>i am not up to date so jsp<end>
<start>be in it i know that the interaction in sunny master and sunny superior would bring nothing but i think even sunny of the future was talking with the crazy prince his might be giga interesting<end>
<start>i will be surprised that weaver did it for such a trivial reason<end>
<start>thank you for the correction the gentleman misled me and i did not check<end>
<start>at least to the chapter<end>
<start>i am not sure<end>
<start>vrm i think his might be amazing as pov<end>
<start>thank you batman in addition to watching over gotham you watch over our reading<end>
<start>since some avatars were not the<end>
<start>mouse too tired to explain tomorrow to you to explain<end>
<start>and may be bitten but he is already pretty cheap like this<end>
<start>it would not shock me<end>
<start>i would soon read it again i would have a headache<end>
<start>just pray he does not join the cassie church<end>
<start>imagine the same princess<end>
<start>shibalaugh you talk about his failure or his ability to give orders<end>
<start>yeah i think so<end>
<start>that is why there is only a wound now or i am in<end>
<start>more than chaps before the end of the volume i have too much<end>
<start>works with the same level of writing as there are hundreds of thousands but we retain it because there is sunny<end>
<start>i do not care what kind of scenario he is setting up<end>
<start>but dcp mtn i wonder how to build mirrors<end>
<start>ah the same level revelation i sit so it is another level ahah<end>
<start>what is his friend doing<end>
<start>i have a doubt when i am still<end>
<start>to find his destiny is to find everything he left for<end>
<start>it will break the balance by creating a crazy faction<end>
<start>for me she knew it already<end>
<start>yes it is true it is a lie i will put the whole week<end>
<start>i imagined it too much like that<end>
<start>or at least it identified its functioning<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthe-eminence-in-shadow-the-eminence-of-shadow-shadow-garden-kage-no-jitsuryokusha-ni-naritakute-kagenou-gif-<end>
<start>i just read the chap and on the discovery of the mystery with the filth that are theirs of the pass and is what someone can explain to me so that i understand better because the c is a little blur with sunny and the key of the estuaore that is a muzzle for the sin of the comfort please<end>
<start>we cannot usurp his name<end>
<start>i can imagine situations<end>
<start>i think not dcp<end>
<start>i think so too<end>
<start>i like nephis omg<end>
<start>when he is not blind by his goals<end>
<start>not necessarily to abandon him<end>
<start>repetition shibalaugh<end>
<start>people often think of kai for death but i do not think so<end>
<start>kanatkh<end>
<start>the sovereign has freed me from my fetters<end>
<start>but it is probably a valor wake<end>
<start>i think he should do - weeks break<end>
<start>in the incomprehension facing the situation of sunny<end>
<start>i do not really see any interest in digging up that side especially that it is probably pretty basic<end>
<start>he lost his destiny<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>it was on the chained islands<end>
<start>sunny said it to one of her reflections nan<end>
<start>we have seen everything<end>
<start>she is using sunny to give a shit if he is happy so he can get what he wants<end>
<start>it is okay i gave it back to you<end>
<start>bah the aspect is layered on the person is the hand them of mordret it is determination but if its domain is reflections it is far too strong<end>
<start>anvil asterion that song and epee breeze did well that may not even have to the end and it did not have a divine aspect as versatile as bitrate<end>
<start>quibest breaks rip<end>
<start>for me yes but i have been questioned in this channel above<end>
<start>the flower was a garment<end>
<start>by killing something<end>
<start>i like it when it changes pov it is cool to have another point of view just when it does that<end>
<start>spoil chap the transformation of sunny i am i do not even know how to describe how i feel it so fantastic laugh<end>
<start>ptet bits a lot since that is all his powers<end>
<start>so be each individual of a god<end>
<start>what is that chicken<end>
<start>finally if sunny cannot move it with the lantern<end>
<start>yeah well see what is done before<end>
<start>apanic pressure<end>
<start>that is the problem too<end>
<start>an impure beast destroys a dormany titan<end>
<start>in front of one of the most powerful awakens of humanity<end>
<start>the nightmare is not over<end>
<start>so she thinks something is wrong<end>
<start>in fashion the principle of sagan extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence<end>
<start>oh i swear with bonodad we are on fire to start this<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwell-i-love-you-gif-<end>
<start>but so the guy he is kind of become a god in itself<end>
<start>but the fact that he is been planned since he is been awake i admit i have not seen him come<end>
<start>it is not practical<end>
<start>psq had destiny there existed at the time or there was not the sortlege<end>
<start>this is crazy<end>
<start>ha yes well seen<end>
<start>yeah i got it but it says avatars cannot talk unless they control them himself<end>
<start>enough that it keeps the mask of weaver and there is no problem it is impossible to recognize it with<end>
<start>because we already know that it will arrive in the water but every time it is cold water like fate remains the same if it arrives to the fountain and has changed its destiny may be that to his next nightmare he spawnerat in hot water shoves this subject here to go too far<end>
<start>the god of mysteres<end>
<start>ha yes it must be pretty much<end>
<start>bro break my theory<end>
<start>it is said at the beginning of the memory volume<end>
<start>you often forget who to talk to you i am the bibliography of shadow slave feyfey<end>
<start>mdr the hype you put on him shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>go and join the top catscreen<end>
<start>the eyes of the beasts also walk as a mirror<end>
<start>they have a line but not complete<end>
<start>he was probably even more<end>
<start>i have the name of the person in addition but unfortunately i cannot do anything<end>
<start>with nephis it is ptet feasible<end>
<start>the overall temporal temperature<end>
<start>or even at the end of the same nightmare but i am not sure<end>
<start>i must have misunderstood it so<end>
<start>if the story ends with just a happy ending because the god forgets will free himself but thousands of years later it will make no sense<end>
<start>i do not understand<end>
<start>we know his fault a bit<end>
<start>i am always wondering if the prince does not have anything to do with reality<end>
<start>his long time i had not had good theory equipment<end>
<start>so yes she is going to finish it with the sword when she is going to see that she is doing almost no damage and that is her only way to survive<end>
<start>i do not think he can kill him<end>
<start>but it will be abnormally short<end>
<start>thank you animepray<end>
<start>but so sunny reunited with her friends for freedom<end>
<start>to my dear einstein<end>
<start>with only incarnation<end>
<start>it is worse<end>
<start>yes or just after jsp<end>
<start>yeah okay i know<end>
<start>you are sure it is in the volume we did not read the same thing<end>
<start>he will need a lot<end>
<start>ptdr c very real<end>
<start>break up<end>
<start>with the step of the shadow the fact that he knows the attack<end>
<start>i am seeing a side story at the end of ss that traces the whole beginning of the mad prince<end>
<start>but i am under pressure about a famous important death that will come<end>
<start>the song are adopted girls<end>
<start>yeah xd<end>
<start>ptdr it is rodr that i ping again<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewof-its-not-false-its-true-agree-gif-<end>
<start>you mean a little like in the shore quote forgets<end>
<start>the new is very well too<end>
<start>already an official english version is planned for in not long<end>
<start>but cannot register mdr<end>
<start>g spoke of transcendent arts chap before the real explanation of sunny<end>
<start>he is or he is the snot<end>
<start>and accepts the<end>
<start>i love these little chaps the return of the sunphis is imminent<end>
<start>it is a theory<end>
<start>really<end>
<start>but the fight against nephis<end>
<start>i like it because there was no romance and the volume yen has its me mad hatred<end>
<start>stv all music is available on youtube normally<end>
<start>no man<end>
<start>why not start war or at least announce<end>
<start>i can see the arrival of valor forces at the fortress<end>
<start>yeah it is just a way to say it but i think you understand the kind of capacity i am talking about<end>
<start>yep i know but it is just that they have been fishing for solitude before so good<end>
<start>it would be too long to watch his appearance of<end>
<start>for you the truth is<end>
<start>but i want to see asterion so i am right<end>
<start>well we have had effigy and kai<end>
<start>this is a possible vote the chair<end>
<start>yeah but then it would be weird for her to die like why the whole thing with the kid if it is to kill them both<end>
<start>pikawow kai<end>
<start>theoriee my reuf<end>
<start>new career for effie<end>
<start>and knowing how to bite<end>
<start>she is machiavelic shibalaaugh<end>
<start>but for sunny he will just stay in the dark<end>
<start>most likely<end>
<start>we learned how to love with sunny oripawnkill<end>
<start>we do not yet know the force of biting and nephis<end>
<start>so it would be more logical than nephis intends to kill the sovereigns then use the people the citadels to enlarge his domain<end>
<start>already nothing but the end of this volume continued crazy between sunny and neph who kills a saint after the level doors that open in the sky and the superior abomination that tracked them throughout the desert wow<end>
<start>but it is already happening in other works so it would not surprise me<end>
<start>what a mess this volume is when<end>
<start>at any time it meets impure titans on godgrave shibalaugh it would be even worse<end>
<start>sinister rock<end>
<start>in any case it would surprise me that we are the answer<end>
<start>if you are talking about the fact that she gave neph the real name<end>
<start>i understand very honestly the feeling although i do not share it<end>
<start>really those lucky bastards we wait every day for the holy gray who posts catscream<end>
<start>i did not think about it<end>
<start>i think it works<end>
<start>his page on average his does really little<end>
<start>we agree that cassie is the smartest of the verse<end>
<start>in real life i have had the beginning of the war that we see the sovereigns move to fight<end>
<start>well she knows it is a godgrave avatar but she cannot feel it because he has anti-divination stuff so he does not get caught either by song or anvil what makes sense since he is the star of the show<end>
<start>with cassie who recruits sunny and nephis who recruits shadow we can be having a cohort with double sunny in it can be very funny<end>
<start>there is no link<end>
<start>so the same condition is not respected<end>
<start>kill them in loop<end>
<start>ptet that his real name is goat too<end>
<start>it is the goal of sunny too<end>
<start>and also kai's craving for those who doubted her would have told me he would die when he did<end>
<start>sunny i think is the master who can carry the most people at the same time<end>
<start>yeah he said it<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbubu-dudu-kisses-in-love-couple-excited-gif-<end>
<start>jpense it is just about her basic personality<end>
<start>jrale not even that is the other jss not even that is who and he wants to make me the guy max benevolence<end>
<start>thank you the g nephis<end>
<start>yes i agree<end>
<start>holy c of rock<end>
<start>of the<end>
<start>beginning of<end>
<start>but i did not know the nothingness was called nothing too<end>
<start>i do not have the hype<end>
<start>if nether saw what destiny he would generate with his choice to leave his line<end>
<start>she is going to make a stone of sand and a pile of soul<end>
<start>its day<end>
<start>vs impossible<end>
<start>the antarctic chapter was long in addition<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewpeace-out-peace-sign-peace-ice-age-eddie-gif-<end>
<start>you live the peak of the work<end>
<start>good ideas<end>
<start>you think cassie can see something in her sea of the ame<end>
<start>yeah plus the long bieeen stuff<end>
<start>we will be busy<end>
<start>in any case with the chaps<end>
<start>i do not think there is any direct translation but he is a bit of a peasant with a more vulgar middle age<end>
<start>yeah end often coach he already played when he was young<end>
<start>like fate rries it or not because it is just the cohort and morgan nobody knew who was mongrel<end>
<start>yeah she is going to piss them off she can take care of herself<end>
<start>i am going crazy<end>
<start>as if sacha killed a pikachu in front of her pikachu<end>
<start>good go i go back to read good theorization mashahello<end>
<start>i was thinking too much about neph's head at that time<end>
<start>it is going to be a big volume<end>
<start>it is just chap in advance<end>
<start>i am more sure<end>
<start>basically the little visions like what she will eat at breakfast they will not change but those in the longer term as the consequences of solstice will change<end>
<start>i am so excited<end>
<start>to go down to the bird thief maybe yes<end>
<start>merciii khlhutao<end>
<start>i am not going to go any further but it is just trashtalk that does not reflect before you talk and hear it on the chapters so for a while it gets boring what<end>
<start>it is not a day i warn in case<end>
<start>to come back to it if there are some who want to share their feeling on this end volume frankly i am taken it interests me a lot by contrast with opinions 'that is null' is good' no thanks x try to develop if you want to discuss it shibalaugh<end>
<start>tyris just held the winter beast sunny killed her ya a dif yes ya probably exaggeration in the v but not as long as that they are already largely holy lambda especially jet<end>
<start>she prefers strangers<end>
<start>nan c last shadow<end>
<start>in any case - you prepare to break something - that you will not go to check the title of the last untranslated chapters<end>
<start>what would be the purpose here<end>
<start>when sunny meets the dark lord before the war council<end>
<start>maybe she knows basic information about people<end>
<start>but there is no connection between the number of divine appearances and the opening of the doors since there have been more rank doors than divine aspect doors<end>
<start>would be our charming prince bitert<end>
<start>in the case of two divine lines meet like sunny and neph<end>
<start>goddamn art<end>
<start>is what she is not going to think he is dead even since he cannot see his own runes anymore it is going to hurt me that nephis sees them in his place otherwise it gives him a reason to stay with her<end>
<start>she sees better without eyes than the others with theirs<end>
<start>with its monster shape<end>
<start>but yes i hate to see the presbyters nightmare since the rulers will probably interact with sunny and the others<end>
<start>it made me think of another scene but i could not find her<end>
<start>ohh no effort shibalaugh<end>
<start>it is too bad otherwise we were at that to have another video projector deruct sunny<end>
<start>if it spawn all transcending the bottom then force the skin thief who will take a monumental spanking by one of the most powerful saint groups in history i think<end>
<start>it is true or gray's going to hit me<end>
<start>the arch lo at the beginning it contained a part convoy<end>
<start>i cry<end>
<start>but in reality the sovereigns cannot even claim the territory as belonging to their domain they should be more powerful than the god of shadow nan<end>
<start>bah already the majority of his cohort was killed<end>
<start>they finally succeeded in killing the saint you think omg the battle turns in their favor it goes away<end>
<start>so you beat the rock<end>
<start>i remember there was something like her but jsp or find him<end>
<start>as a sleeper he had to be as beautiful as a wake up see even a master<end>
<start>in real life it will not surprise me that he made one<end>
<start>but at the same time do not know them<end>
<start>hell nah<end>
<start>if you want to keep going but do not say i did not tell you hehe<end>
<start>it is when he came back into sunny's soul but it was thanks to his reflection that he fought<end>
<start>then your opinion on the beginning of the volume<end>
<start>maybe there is something over titan<end>
<start>i have a theory that the sortlege of the nightmare will be partly controlled by the gods forget who will explain why the seeds of the nightmare will appear after the war of chaos and test them to become stronger also it pass something during the war that made the sortlege become part of the domain of the gods forget but not totally corrupt either<end>
<start>like a little like that<end>
<start>it is really sunny who kills the other creatures of the nightmare that would have been too dangerous<end>
<start>good go less blabla more reading<end>
<start>you think that groove will be what rank at the end of the story<end>
<start>it was even aero-nef<end>
<start>skill exit i think beluga<end>
<start>but in any case now cassie disturbs me too much and i doubt everything she says<end>
<start>this is shadow slave<end>
<start>he told me i hope snow is happy<end>
<start>i do not know but i am going to sleep<end>
<start>well that does not tell me by whom<end>
<start>personal i am just unable to wait the same day so i did not ask myself the question shibalaugh i managed to hold even not day before reading the chapters in advance in english mdr<end>
<start>on a misunderstanding and a lot of preparation<end>
<start>the aspects of the sovereigns are very interested<end>
<start>yep i like that too in real life it goes well in addition i find kai always being someone painted by sunny as having everything to succeed beautiful charm luck etc a dragon was technically a superior species it fits well i like and then it allows him to have the power boost that was missing him<end>
<start>i will see when i read<end>
<start>so is what a line can have multiple carriers<end>
<start>fall chapter<end>
<start>ptdrrr<end>
<start>the thing that makes me shit out of it all the bow on yards that is set up from the beginning of the nightmare we tell us all the horror of the defilement with the first researcher after we learn that it is part of the that he managed to adore the troops of the king serpent who was a fucking sovereign and at the end his pass to the trap to go to estuary i would even have kiffer have a pov nephis during his confrontation with the first researcher and his sound that my most on top kermitepressed<end>
<start>do not read<end>
<start>well it is not like you are crossing top-class creatures every day<end>
<start>so oe c not snake mrc gray<end>
<start>ya gray in the shadow<end>
<start>i confess that his match is good<end>
<start>so removing his destiny will change the physical perception of people hmm<end>
<start>so neph knows the goutds and heritary clans too<end>
<start>but you have read everything too<end>
<start>sleepers cannot even use gasoline anymore<end>
<start>tkt<end>
<start>not the god of emotions i believe<end>
<start>titan superieur should not abuse my coconut<end>
<start>hahaha honestly i cannot read some other mdrr<end>
<start>i had a good teacher for that shibalagh<end>
<start>normal is the strongest<end>
<start>but he had just passed holy at that time<end>
<start>i am too hype ptn we cannot have chapters a day<end>
<start>it is true but<end>
<start>i like this atmosphere too much<end>
<start>it does not work like that in life<end>
<start>i am going to go check when i am still<end>
<start>neph talks about it in v<end>
<start>space<end>
<start>cassie will be able to make the link between the lord of shadows and sunny already<end>
<start>hi thank you for your message it makes pleasure to see emiliahappy i am against the idea of pdf and epub for several reasons i am already quite busy with the translation and i do not want to eternalize on what is more the translation is in perpetual change there are always things that i modify so make every modification on the site thank you pdf but no thanks more if webnovel falls on me i will be obliged to make disappear my translation so i want to maximum control the acquisition of my translations<end>
<start>and would allow us to see if he is stronger than a more conventional saint<end>
<start>am i wrong<end>
<start>in truth can be even the saint<end>
<start>for me it is the line of nether<end>
<start>who thought it was true<end>
<start>the author has just announced that we are at half work ptdrrrr<end>
<start>yeah but he is a bit of his character even though<end>
<start>if you want you will be the first prayer mdrr i will be second but shibalaugh<end>
<start>like he has to come back to the real world so she can hatch<end>
<start>i had moved the parlor and i had taken too much spoil because of that<end>
<start>is or at g<end>
<start>he really took the place of his future version ptdrrrrrr<end>
<start>ananke tells them something like that if you want to wretched vs pass transcendent mtn but you should have dozens of years to waste<end>
<start>besides how come he is still alive<end>
<start>she is crazy<end>
<start>the return of sunny alcoholizes<end>
<start>his maddened me to tell me that sunny and holy nephis if they are alongside they increase the contrast as the philsteric photos<end>
<start>we will see but not for a long time i think<end>
<start>with maybe another extra way but at least that<end>
<start>a good tragic pass with the reason why he hates his default would be perfect<end>
<start>who are you sir<end>
<start>abetaptap<end>
<start>i did not read but i will think about the return of sunny on the shore forgets<end>
<start>i have been wrong too<end>
<start>besides i will finally stop spam in mp a gray laugh<end>
<start>i confess i did not know the sybils so i figured it out<end>
<start>and in his domain he will be able to invoke the shadows of all those whom he killed<end>
<start>so if you want to join them you can apply xd<end>
<start>so i say potentially shit but at any time snake does not break the will of the superior but just the unniverse laws or just the one of death<end>
<start>i have been recommended the thing<end>
<start>you are going to chain direct v it is finished soon it seems to me<end>
<start>but the top is composed of these<end>
<start>except if he was in the rdr see the earth<end>
<start>square i change davis titan dormant bat bete impure<end>
<start>yeah but is a ruler with no domain so much more powerful than a saint<end>
<start>bah it announces war what<end>
<start>so now that i am throwing it is okay<end>
<start>trauma<end>
<start>thank you very much<end>
<start>oe but it keeps the hype while giving us news of other people<end>
<start>the worst part is that his could walk back from gasoline in the air to provide him<end>
<start>the transfo of the saints do not listen to their essence i believe or very little<end>
<start>there is a master with them but he is not the leader of the dcp convoy i mixed<end>
<start>my girl<end>
<start>i read it all tomorrow<end>
<start>the way he does it is the best but it is too frustrating when even<end>
<start>like he can create a mini rdr<end>
<start>i feel sorry for you<end>
<start>supreme memory of lvl i doubt it is a simple hourglass<end>
<start>ah good<end>
<start>we know like months before cassie lived a year in the city and then they took months until the final fight<end>
<start>i do not know if that is mentioned but we know how the first blackcurrant nightmare went<end>
<start>the interactions between sunny and groove are masterful<end>
<start>but since its aspect did not have any relation with its line of the god of war<end>
<start>i do not think we will see much later anyway<end>
<start>i am coming soon<end>
<start>in sah it is possible mdrr<end>
<start>his visions have been changed to a sunny beak or they have taken into account the fact that sunny is fatless<end>
<start>it is not the only thing she got from her master<end>
<start>i was more sure<end>
<start>i do not have the story but i do not think it is going to be a good time to revive her if it is going to be near the x-ban<end>
<start>i like it when sunny has social interactions<end>
<start>you are going to have to show me the pass because it does not ring a bell<end>
<start>it is not the same fate<end>
<start>and like she is already become a master<end>
<start>and his would surprise me that biting himself came in such a court time<end>
<start>shore forgets for me<end>
<start>says their rodr<end>
<start>the kebab of the corner except that hiss cost the ball<end>
<start>basically we know he is a titan<end>
<start>i should not have said<end>
<start>because i do not think sunny has any particular hatred of the sortlege<end>
<start>it was like a hype train<end>
<start>the mistake she made on the shore and that she regrets crazy<end>
<start>there is the theory that noctis is on the moon<end>
<start>everything depends only on his management of the work as for the moment he makes a taff and which jsuis hype perso<end>
<start>you are talking about the bird thief<end>
<start>finish<end>
<start>i think the shadow weaving will merge with the shadow weaving that sunny thought she had<end>
<start>i will not forget this sacrifice<end>
<start>yesterday from me today from g from me<end>
<start>i always love this person a lot but the with the shocky revelations it passes into another dimension<end>
<start>he has more access to the memory that could have been very useful<end>
<start>i am not saying otherwise<end>
<start>that is right ptdrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>bah after c not necessarily antagonistic asterion<end>
<start>in the direction of return<end>
<start>but i agree with you that there is no match<end>
<start>there is a passage in his chap or he is talking about someone or something he hates even more than anvil you imagine the thing the guy who wants to kill his dad took everything and there is something he hates even more<end>
<start>no but his tells us that the forgotten god must be the most powerful of the pantheon<end>
<start>when even g broke the nightmare loop from now on<end>
<start>c his false fighting style sah<end>
<start>nothing between antarctic when he did not have the fragment of the shadow domain he was already able to carry everyone<end>
<start>sunny who does a lot of terrifying abominations and does not leave a single gem<end>
<start>she is not going to say to herself<end>
<start>i believe that this was a demon<end>
<start>and it would be style to say yes we have been there since the beginning made her real name<end>
<start>and the category door that you say appeared long before asterion and others became supreme at the time it was still that masters the best he could send to slow down the door his immortal flames that were a master<end>
<start>who is also the forgotten god<end>
<start>that is probably the case but i hope<end>
<start>and then good the first part of the antarctic was stressful never of time to blow mdr<end>
<start>more dangerous for valor is all<end>
<start>it is really from this volume that i actually described as a masterpiece<end>
<start>i am looking for dcp on what date the chap was posted and i am even the same of that day they are genial<end>
<start>a little before -<end>
<start>i am trying to understand<end>
<start>seeing that it looks like the classic<end>
<start>sah bites when he is going to be holy it is not going to be fun<end>
<start>she thinks it is a stamp<end>
<start>i have missed you<end>
<start>eh<end>
<start>all that has to do is wake up naturally it is not so hard there are many people who had to do it in the last millenaries ah bah no<end>
<start>i do not know if his has already been said or not but i have a little theory that in the sunny's am there is a kind of citadel and that can be when he unlocks the power of a supreme it is creation will be able to take the citadel as a portal and make us a small arise there is a good chance that someone has already said it but i am thinking about it may be late mdr<end>
<start>join them out of envy and not because of all their propaganda<end>
<start>maybe he will win that freedom but not at any price<end>
<start>i am already rereading shibalaugh just after i catch up<end>
<start>it mintrigues but the real asterion has a palace in my skull<end>
<start>or there would be emeutes shibalaugh<end>
<start>oh his kills me laughing his in the theater room<end>
<start>they are just confident about their ability especially anvil to take care of her<end>
<start>there was a mark daughter dan english chap<end>
<start>so i am going to<end>
<start>true if he does spawn daeron in the part of the domain of the god of shadow therefore with divine shadows<end>
<start>she is just going to get lightning strike<end>
<start>but i am pretty sure it is from the daemon<end>
<start>the i validate strong it is perfect pile in the context of j-o and the vibe leon merchant it is very strong<end>
<start>man for the chap gray the period batman is over<end>
<start>if weaver or someone else is involved it could be more of an influence on how to create and use tools has its availability rather than to achieve a desired goal<end>
<start>so at best he feels a pain in the soul ultra atrocious at worst he loses a core<end>
<start>she could not know<end>
<start>you think vrmt it will break the bond of shadow<end>
<start>the flight on the titan that gives him the sin of loneliness<end>
<start>there is no relationship between the i assure you<end>
<start>he turned paper into gold g the alchemist<end>
<start>i hope he is the strongest of the saints but i guess he has to vary according to the situation<end>
<start>it is going to be a shadow tear<end>
<start>nightmares are replicas of the dream world not the real dream world<end>
<start>sunny modest shibalaugh shibalaugh it is anything but modest sunny shibalaugh<end>
<start>the thing that made me the most like it is sunny in pls a lo<end>
<start>she is her brother's sister<end>
<start>i was thinking more about auro or daeron<end>
<start>he has a transcendent art and i think that sunny with that is more dangerous than - sunny in demon mode<end>
<start>i am going to stop talking about the shadows<end>
<start>pq ketch of ananke the tip is more like a piece of chain breaker<end>
<start>it is a little dark mc making overheat shadows<end>
<start>plus she is the only one who wants her birthdays<end>
<start>i understand but if ever it is that the two brothers of fate<end>
<start>theoretical brain<end>
<start>and it is biting do not talk impossible that valor starts from the principle that he died<end>
<start>oh that makes you think of the god of forgetfulness<end>
<start>i would find that too bad because he does not use it except in the temporal vortex<end>
<start>especially when we knew it was going to happen<end>
<start>it is especially the author who uses it ' and to answer the other part of your sentence i try to make my translation unique<end>
<start>she is going to die<end>
<start>sunny is still quiet anyway for now as the connection between him and shadow is impossible to make<end>
<start>we all have to go through the<end>
<start>or other stuff<end>
<start>it is the rewards he cannot get<end>
<start>irronia cannot live without her dose of daytime ss<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewssoma-shokugeki-no-soma-shout-rage-rip-shirt-gif-<end>
<start>she cannot remember that he is her old companion etc<end>
<start>so if she just wanted to treat sunny like a weapon<end>
<start>look at the bg she had in front<end>
<start>since he is awake he can go into the world of dreams of himself<end>
<start>people think he is the one who went to the moon with his ship to put the seeds of the nightmare in it<end>
<start>that is who already ariel please i took over the volume and it is mentioned but i forgot who it was<end>
<start>and then the author just put a shadow creation to boost sunny<end>
<start>in real life i have never had a pref perso ct volume always of the moment of banker etc that there was and that i appreciate but the number of moment of banker in the last volume exceeds from far all the rest<end>
<start>the door is an extension of their sovereign capacity<end>
<start>the dog it came out exactly the sentence that my most reached to the lepoque pepecry<end>
<start>daeron is just an example i am talking about the superior creation in general<end>
<start>average<end>
<start>while i was not up to date i saw the notarials of every message when i lit my pc<end>
<start>mama the power of holy<end>
<start>even nephis is afraid<end>
<start>and i think effie can die in the chaps<end>
<start>yeah like everybody else but that is not why he is going to die<end>
<start>batman never restes he will rest when he is dead<end>
<start>the sovereigns are not so powerful either out of their domain<end>
<start>well later on i guess but for now he does not seem to be the case<end>
<start>yeah i am thinking about something like that too<end>
<start>real c impossible to know<end>
<start>chapters<end>
<start>in fact the last revelation on cassie gave me a second guess but with everything that followed i could not even enjoy it again<end>
<start>but cassie what to banger this persono what this level aaaaah catscream<end>
<start>if the author proceeds<end>
<start>after so long<end>
<start>but normally we know she is awake<end>
<start>because otherwise holy would already be supreme<end>
<start>i got confused<end>
<start>on principle he put his soul into the room for creations it seems logical<end>
<start>honestly in any case if he had talked about their first encounter at the shore forgets they would just all forget so no prblm<end>
<start>in history<end>
<start>with whom<end>
<start>but i did not think he would protect the fellows too<end>
<start>i have some rest of the pinguin c for his<end>
<start>i wanted to ask you if there was a reason for the fact that at the beginning cassia was called cassia some times or if it was just a typo<end>
<start>mdr neph who will visit<end>
<start>nephis<end>
<start>bah no change mtn is rather logical<end>
<start>i guess it is going to be crazy<end>
<start>yeah i see that<end>
<start>but<end>
<start>okay i thought it was the other way around<end>
<start>there would have been when<end>
<start>bahn for me just have to ask<end>
<start>i am not on the dayrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>that is what saved him from biting too<end>
<start>ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<end>
<start>cassie said if he came he would be free from fate and the bond of shadow<end>
<start>or there is a way that natural wakes are stronger than wakes by the nightmare that is why he does not get in his nightmare<end>
<start>those who wanted romance are served<end>
<start>i know you like it when you are sick<end>
<start>ptn we are finally going back and forth v sunny bete winter and fuck that what we expected the one<end>
<start>it is out of the blue how she managed to do everything but i think it will happen when it happens even without her help i think she just accelerated things for sunny<end>
<start>become sovereign<end>
<start>cuz debate is our speciality<end>
<start>uh remember they said it was a huge flower housing a young girl inside<end>
<start>for example a person inspired by nephis and branded by sunny may contribute to both areas<end>
<start>dcp jai cook<end>
<start>but so cassie can see it<end>
<start>sunny will be able to concentrate on her power away from all the worries with clans<end>
<start>after that is normal<end>
<start>meh<end>
<start>what in itself is better<end>
<start>they are in minecraft<end>
<start>so if the lines come up before the exit is normal that it milks too<end>
<start>like all the actions that we put on others' backs when we say vzy sunny is a buffoon<end>
<start>a double jump and a dash<end>
<start>sunny talks about it in one of the last chap ya not necessarily correspondence<end>
<start>i could meet cassie at least<end>
<start>mmh not on that<end>
<start>sunny has succeeded solo an unclean titan<end>
<start>not yet<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>i jme said good sunny sah it may have a fifth level of a supreme but nan<end>
<start>he did not say he was not everything did a supreme and it would be some kind of in between but can sunny become supreme if we forget most things about him<end>
<start>and the nightmare is always more or less adapted to the power of the person<end>
<start>c what account that posts on ss because i have never<end>
<start>nothing to see but that she has a theory of why sunny happens so much to feel the shadows in the last chapter<end>
<start>continue to read<end>
<start>i asked how it is that there is more com under the chapters from about chapters<end>
<start>amazing the last chapter<end>
<start>it is the way to pretend to be the author and sell kindle so it is fake you do not have to buy this<end>
<start>terror i guessed it is not difficult but only wake up<end>
<start>i find it hard to understand sunny sharing memories from the nightmare and then to make her understand that they know each other from the beginning cf the beginning of the forgotten shore but if he manages to make everything understand a breaky so she instantly forgets<end>
<start>i had zappe c cnest noctis who wrote ca shibalaugh<end>
<start>during the first meeting of shadow and morgan<end>
<start>i swear if it keeps going up the cassie church with bonodad really she makes masterclasses<end>
<start>for me the nightmare of the god forgets it is the kingdom of dreams<end>
<start>and hop it triggers larc asterion<end>
<start>there is not much to do except wait a while had to see the shadows so there is a chance that shadow has a connection to all this<end>
<start>i think it is part of my pref chaps<end>
<start>and if the moon had not become a creation of the nightmare<end>
<start>what a barbaric rhythm nempeche<end>
<start>mamama<end>
<start>it was great minimum but really great sovereign minimum<end>
<start>to save her baby girl<end>
<start>reread all in real life it is not very long shibalaugh<end>
<start>also<end>
<start>and the content is too epic<end>
<start>then how divine attackers are held in the exitleges himself<end>
<start>the potential is crazy<end>
<start>normally it is in the top bar<end>
<start>with better memories more and more as the supreme creations are more and more frequent<end>
<start>it is going to be a fairly consistent volume when even chap not bad<end>
<start>but dcp<end>
<start>months after starting for the first time i had already started reading again<end>
<start>tyrant superior<end>
<start>superior<end>
<start>master he beats a beast superior<end>
<start>sunny could lie even if he had to say the truth<end>
<start>dacc and then it is with kindle or not<end>
<start>i did not understand everything but since sunny does not exist anymore mongrel also depop<end>
<start>of the volume i just finished<end>
<start>i swear<end>
<start>let us gooooooooo<end>
<start>she is not completely selfish you can see that she is been on this from the shore forgets<end>
<start>ah my bad<end>
<start>well for me<end>
<start>please<end>
<start>also you think that the nameless temple can tp the sunny domain fragment with it<end>
<start>and nightmare never of life something happens to her<end>
<start>but i do not think so either<end>
<start>mp<end>
<start>i am at the moment when ananke disappeared and they found the boat of noctis and i am full of theory in my head<end>
<start>he has more limits<end>
<start>i am stunned i am looking forward to the rest<end>
<start>but tops are about the corrupt would be too weak to be called as it is by sunny<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewagain-ryan-higatv-one-more-time-once-again-gif-<end>
<start>sunny is already the reflection when we say world it is the world in which we live the earth yes but also our whole universe<end>
<start>jai hate quion see him fighting hard<end>
<start>like the feeling that they were all laughing<end>
<start>i did not feel like he was separated from his real name because he cannot lose him because he is his real name that is his identity i think he has to find a way to relink to his name to find his destiny<end>
<start>by working together it can be done<end>
<start>ha created space you think it is the piece of the shadow domain<end>
<start>your fav volume of the work or just among those who have less action<end>
<start>especially what in the end he learned that it takes his divinity to create life<end>
<start>one more date huh<end>
<start>arthur did not get his bonus<end>
<start>ueep qlq something of the genre is possible also after two months it is really long qd even<end>
<start>this is crazy<end>
<start>cassie who arranges one night for nephis with sunny and effie who would try to bring cassie and sunny together it looks the same in the church with the people behind each other<end>
<start>oh ptn i am finally up to date<end>
<start>or just beating the person inside his own soul<end>
<start>but mm if the seal becomes deformed it will be weakened since its soul broke into daemons<end>
<start>you climb the serious messages far beyond her<end>
<start>debatable<end>
<start>she will see it coming<end>
<start>the question would be holy fielon nightmare sunny<end>
<start>unless he is stabbing us in the back and showing us a groove<end>
<start>i forgot<end>
<start>ah bah on the wood end of the coup<end>
<start>it is the one i think<end>
<start>only bonus<end>
<start>in truth i resonate in pk it is on the moon<end>
<start>but i think what wanted to confirm that sunny was the lantarctic devil<end>
<start>i hope for him too if not massacre<end>
<start>and in real life i think that anvil and that song are rather average for sovereigns<end>
<start>go sunny you can do it you can cross them<end>
<start>see how empty i feel since i finished the volume yesterday<end>
<start>ehe<end>
<start>but dcp if qqn returns to the real world is what he gets summoned<end>
<start>i speak rather a different rank sunny had his fragment of divine domain as master while morgan is a saint with lentierete of a supreme domain in this scenario<end>
<start>we cannot know how to go about it it is a unique case<end>
<start>yeah he is going the other way<end>
<start>bahahahahahahhah<end>
<start>how a saint can hope to do something against a cursed terror<end>
<start>only the row is not the level<end>
<start>just in case you did not understand you are not eating with them<end>
<start>and it is obviously mine the holy tree<end>
<start>i would have said the same sight how g disrespected<end>
<start>a dead leaf physics<end>
<start>their class does not work the same way<end>
<start>where i think he is going to get back to mind before the others and leave<end>
<start>she still has a little way to go<end>
<start>mordret too shocked me during the work that even the lack of information keeps me from<end>
<start>so she is going to have a first nightmare when she already has all that he can offer<end>
<start>not stupid like theory<end>
<start>nop me i am the chain breaker i am for freedom i pray who i want whenever i want<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>nightmare not fielon<end>
<start>bah perso bitert i love it but we lack too much info on it for me then i avoided sunny seeing that it is the mc and that with the lack of change of pov it is already 'too' represent so i preferred to vote secondary persos then bah cassie because it makes that to bluff me holy it is holy and the crazy prince it is because the dreams of his plan within the nightmare shocked me<end>
<start>had to be out of the blue<end>
<start>and also strange because it seems that the relationship to the world so the place or the moment where a master can extract spiritual energy is different from his domain<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewrio-rio-movie-rio-riomovie-blu-gif-<end>
<start>uh so i have to see again<end>
<start>we are here to appreciate your beautiful excelent without default perfect translation<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfrench-frozen-neurchi-con-peux-gif-<end>
<start>he is relatively quiet<end>
<start>sleeping aspect<end>
<start>from the moment when cnest exit en we consider that it spoils nobody here no<end>
<start>it is going to be shit in the valor rabgs<end>
<start>i kind of think it is not hereditary that is just how people chose to pass them on<end>
<start>that would mean his fault would be like a physical thing<end>
<start>it is the best<end>
<start>more like the coat attribute<end>
<start>yeah right down there was max of fallen creations<end>
<start>it is stamp<end>
<start>bahhahahahahahaha<end>
<start>gray to explain here<end>
<start>naaaan<end>
<start>then maybe he checked the house of the night after that<end>
<start>nan pitie nan shibalaugh<end>
<start>sunny has a plan to kill a sovereign out of his domain as a saint<end>
<start>i have got the guts to pull it up<end>
<start>for now yes<end>
<start>personal i would say more song<end>
<start>honestly when you see the evolution of the ability to go into the dream realm it will not surprise me that in the end people create their own kingdom<end>
<start>aie fucking it is sad for chaps<end>
<start>what the hell is the anemone bow<end>
<start>we are going to have to fight or it is a shame<end>
<start>nan it is totally contrary to what he wants to do if he wants to wake up without a nightmare it is not just because he knows it is possible it is because he understood something we do not know<end>
<start>to specify the clan of shadow exists by them<end>
<start>i just finished the volume<end>
<start>since he was mentioned that noctis has a ship that can go into space and that he is one of the top pretres of the nightmare<end>
<start>he is born of the god of dreams like other daemons<end>
<start>and that she alone could know and that he had not to worry about being caught<end>
<start>he can do the demon of the nd cmr<end>
<start>while asterion that do not we should be afraid it is nothing<end>
<start>neither can really defeat the other sunny is more powerful but cannot definitely kill him<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>i wait for you at the end feyfey<end>
<start>in any case he is crazy this guy so impossible to convince<end>
<start>the true asterion x<end>
<start>a sdf who leaves pieces of him everywhere<end>
<start>and those who are too weak to bear are willing to die<end>
<start>my dream<end>
<start>the hollow mountains is vrm the death zone what is thought to be<end>
<start>like he can say some groovy stuff that she will not forget but if he said it to others they would forget if the factor was knowing that information before then pk cassie forgot what sunny told him about his parents' tree<end>
<start>the death of the man of nephis would do much more harm to valor than if he remained alive<end>
<start>leak<end>
<start>we went through the same moment<end>
<start>especially that phoenix are known to be able to cure and attack as nephis as part of chance<end>
<start>sunny vs impure beast who wins<end>
<start>so as sovereigns with a cohort he can try the piaf<end>
<start>it is just over tomorrow forget if that is it<end>
<start>for me it will be kai or effie<end>
<start>o so i do not think he is going to try to do it<end>
<start>sunny was not wiped out the way it was the sortlege just scrambled up to make him look like an oblivious person<end>
<start>as long as you do not get the dees it is fine with me<end>
<start>same god httpsdiscordcomchannels<end>
<start>because while waiting to read everything to read the rest you read all the new chaps at once and not daily<end>
<start>yes supreme forgiveness<end>
<start>it is already bcp catscream<end>
<start>no we do not have any information about that<end>
<start>hmm so they are not vrmt zn competition with the big clan that is why they do not make war dcp<end>
<start>would it not be better to put and fear nothing without negation because nothing has left more a concept than an absence of something<end>
<start>yeah but she is titan so that is weird no<end>
<start>a good bed does not argue<end>
<start>big projector with real people in the shibalaugh<end>
<start>it is not shadow like your shadow<end>
<start>but i know what you mean<end>
<start>it is hard not to take back shadow slave<end>
<start>it is so irrational what he is doing<end>
<start>she is years old i think that level aparance there is not really much difference between the now<end>
<start>i would not lie to you<end>
<start>but if he ever goes to see a guy and he tells him yeah sunless the lantarctic devil bah they will forget<end>
<start>chapter and bananas<end>
<start>stop tik tok<end>
<start>oe probably<end>
<start>so with her he is not scary either<end>
<start>i did not see it like that<end>
<start>god bless i live only for that now<end>
<start>a thought for effiy that will think can snatch sunny until he reveals himself to be the lord of shadows<end>
<start>the good old times with chapters per day in pdf<end>
<start>i have got faq check on exactly the same question and yeah for now askip it is not planned<end>
<start>no chapters tomorrow i have to respect the release of g<end>
<start>by the way poor groove she finds herself in the sauce<end>
<start>when the cat is not the mice dance<end>
<start>well he is either presumed dead or in the nightmare right now<end>
<start>far too simple<end>
<start>nephis is not going to remember him it seems to me<end>
<start>case<end>
<start>or corrupt<end>
<start>sunny does expres to lose or neph wins er deg<end>
<start>asterion would not be much in the space of the rdr rather than in the space of the earth<end>
<start>after i think that following a volume chapter by chapter and all of a sudden you really feel it not the same when you are born you really notice every chapter<end>
<start>and we cannot even guess what is going to happen<end>
<start>after i think that an alliance between the two would carnage<end>
<start>i feel like tonight we are going to go back to the pov sunny after i do not know if i prefer the pov sunny merchant or the pov sunnyeur of the shadows<end>
<start>um um<end>
<start>it was missing i find<end>
<start>i think neph or sunny have their chance in duel<end>
<start>you cannot imagine<end>
<start>just like you think the war will last cmb of time<end>
<start>ptet that nephis does not want to kill the psq sovereigns she invents<end>
<start>like pk the weaver line eats so easily that of the shadow god<end>
<start>after there may be minimal authority<end>
<start>but in the great majority it is quite respectful about spoil most of the time jsuis a jour sur la trad de gray et pas sur la vo and i have never been spoiled here<end>
<start>we all knew her real existence since tjr because we finally got her name<end>
<start>there is something in the chaps that came out<end>
<start>it must exist but it is no use right now<end>
<start>if but as they appeared up in the river i think they spent less time in it after i said maybe shit<end>
<start>in addition it is enough that qqun at song can read the memories and bitret may have had a global idea of the way to take<end>
<start>also it is true no it is okay i am not complaining yet i will come to console myself by doing theory with you here when i am done<end>
<start>anekoprod<end>
<start>but i had forgotten about this crazy thing<end>
<start>and you see that in the end it was nephis who made expres to lose so the vision really was not a helper on it<end>
<start>shibalaugh nephis who wakes up<end>
<start>i mean she knew her in advance<end>
<start>but i do not understand what triggers the phenomene of forgetfulness in people who know sunny for example cassie seems to hold that sunny is a comrade of the same year as she is but it should not be impossible<end>
<start>please what already the rank of titans that appeared at the end of the war between valor and song<end>
<start>but you think that is who the real name is<end>
<start>for me more<end>
<start>or other people who have a capacity that does that<end>
<start>i am in shock huh<end>
<start>and well they ended up but not as i imagined<end>
<start>but yes i also think that neph will have something exceptional<end>
<start>i would say that it is not possible that only one of the two sovereigns has a divine aspect because he would have crushed the other as the divine aspect of the war it seems to be bitrate who possesses it i suppose the sovereign has no divine aspect and the most likely to have this aspect it would be one of his adopted daughters<end>
<start>i am at the end of the peeling<end>
<start>but at the same time its glue only with its attributes<end>
<start>cbpray<end>
<start>but originally it was not an area of the dream realm<end>
<start>he prefers to rest on something else i agree<end>
<start>is what the aspect of sunny has developed at the end of the same nightmare because it no longer has a real name so it can no longer make it known to have a master or it is still tied to nephis but it certainly has a real name that is different from lost from the light or the same but just that it remembers more and that it has to find it because it is a little witchy of the names not sorry if it is not clear<end>
<start>i see it spawn at the end in fashion<end>
<start>cassie but what a fucking bitch<end>
<start>you know the guy who thinks he is bread<end>
<start>have to do reading sessions from morning to evening<end>
<start>the rdr also absorbs space that is why some parts of the rdr have different sky times tantot sun<end>
<start>except weaver's is going to say she is not a family<end>
<start>what is the dance of the shadow<end>
<start>that says i agree with you<end>
<start>oe but g will not skip the nightmare<end>
<start>oh yeah no catscream<end>
<start>the dream god divided into daemons<end>
<start>ah prck real people are not pseudos talking<end>
<start>you see pnj in the games bah this is the same especially level ia integr shibalaugh<end>
<start>okay thank you bro i am taking back some stuff<end>
<start>had to be real<end>
<start>we do not know if she accepted the tattoo again<end>
<start>it depends on the chapters and the size of the fonts but it stays when even a normal size for a book chapter<end>
<start>current volume<end>
<start>i have hate for the nephis-sunny fight tonight<end>
<start>it is true that the end of the volume was very heavy<end>
<start>since ellipse is just my favorite character<end>
<start>dacc<end>
<start>she is a little nice<end>
<start>it remains great minimum chap<end>
<start>in this case<end>
<start>the same<end>
<start>yep x<end>
<start>they will move on<end>
<start>he did not want to do it<end>
<start>banger that one<end>
<start>exact and his old madman tries to corrupt him once he brings him back to life mdr<end>
<start>c weaver<end>
<start>and it is like an almost instant exit<end>
<start>it is the return of the high ruler<end>
<start>interesting ahah<end>
<start>he was doing studies on the moon before<end>
<start>like i feel the lines<end>
<start>i agree<end>
<start>you are the best<end>
<start>in real life it is an excellent first novel<end>
<start>yeah i guess i am already laughing at sunny in daeron vs lord of fright the fight looks heavy<end>
<start>and his son also strength has him<end>
<start>it takes two minimum<end>
<start>you will notice that cassie is the only do not we do not really know the filthy version<end>
<start>c of metal<end>
<start>i am talking about the sunny in this mtn<end>
<start>so there is a good chance it is true if g took the time to mention it<end>
<start>i think his rest his will but weaver left them the tools for<end>
<start>it was a little confrection of the ring and the first thing that had a ring is echo it made me laugh<end>
<start>it would be the best gift for my birthday it is not my birthday i say that to tamadouer<end>
<start>we are on the same page<end>
<start>he is already fucked with the sunny bets<end>
<start>go spoil<end>
<start>mdr you say that there is a world where the effie guy is the greatest antagonist of the work<end>
<start>and that is a theory that was out on the serv and that bcp of the world had totally valid<end>
<start>if noctis is in the tomb maybe he came on the chain breaker and kind of since we know he is awe-inspiring that at night he would have abated himself on the way because the night in the desert she is not quiet ok will say<end>
<start>so personal i would say he is had the citadel for max - months<end>
<start>att i will try to get you messages from the world on this<end>
<start>i do not even know how to open this channel<end>
<start>intervention<end>
<start>so beautiful<end>
<start>i can justice you here laughs<end>
<start>he is too strong<end>
<start>the poor he is the only person who wants to join his gang<end>
<start>i would laugh bcp less that is on<end>
<start>but just i do it alive in the chapters where i am like he says that the seal that holds the abyss will be life and that it is the god who did it but as the seal weakens then it will take god to seal it again and then the next one will be the cohort but his will be rather because sunny is more in destiny and so his will come back as before yen will have one we do not know<end>
<start>yeah sure it would be<end>
<start>her mistress<end>
<start>shibalaugh anyway explains how sunny managed to return to the pyramid<end>
<start>after<end>
<start>and you must also awaken your appearance<end>
<start>a little fishing chair and a beer is perfect<end>
<start>what the fuck was that<end>
<start>what ship objective meaningless<end>
<start>i think it was<end>
<start>do not think<end>
<start>the exitlege does not give the appearances according to the first name<end>
<start>so if i do not say shit normally if there is no biting reflection cannot move into the mirror world<end>
<start>chapter<end>
<start>which is a day vf of the coup<end>
<start>i am in a hurry to find out how the sortlege named her<end>
<start>there is no strength to have<end>
<start>it is written white on gray catscreen<end>
<start>at least we found our lonely sunny and i knew it a little<end>
<start>it seems to me bzr<end>
<start>i also think effie<end>
<start>bah for me this restriction applies that has sunny<end>
<start>not everyone<end>
<start>it seems to me more logical that he has a connection to the cyou are<end>
<start>she was talking about after her hair<end>
<start>we will see hyn<end>
<start>mtn we can tjr call gray or it is just batman yes i made an effort<end>
<start>there is a popularity poll on the g-serv<end>
<start>go man i would spoil her otherwise<end>
<start>chapter currently if jet dies against the winter beast i also die<end>
<start>never of life would they return there as a simple saint<end>
<start>i meant to say tome<end>
<start>she did not break your fate<end>
<start>the first<end>
<start>it does not work anymore because sunny has no real name<end>
<start>then we are not going to find out because he does not have the little voice when he kills the monsters<end>
<start>the fleche that pierces her into a mamama ice palace<end>
<start>not in each time the same it was on a boat but yes there is a connection with the water every time<end>
<start>maybe braille one day<end>
<start>they may just have a part of it<end>
<start>okay i do not understand how easy it is to share it with the other volumes too<end>
<start>yup i think it is really connected to destiny everything has been erased about sunny including their memories and if they do not remember it again and the re-forgetting is because it does not connect to the canvas of destiny that connects everything it does as if you are trying to sew in the vacuum to plug a hole it does not fit and it passes through the canvas of fate directly<end>
<start>we will see if it is the only thing that blocks me we will have the answer soon<end>
<start>future sunny told her not to go<end>
<start>ah yeah i am stupid<end>
<start>snake all the memories he could create<end>
<start>when it is not perfectly perfect and structure in a way that does not even leave you wondering<end>
<start>just the sovereigns are a hair stronger than gunlaug then she prepares a little more<end>
<start>if i am not mistaken sunny was talking about all the memories he had to create and talking about his sister's memory<end>
<start>it depends<end>
<start>and she guesses the bond he shared with them<end>
<start>i am fan fan fan and already missing camillawink<end>
<start>after the state in which sunny is a little similar to the daemon of oblivion<end>
<start>sunny still has the shadow domain fragment<end>
<start>chuck norris vs weaver who wins<end>
<start>he could not do much that could shock cassie<end>
<start>it seems to me rather logical in view of the events<end>
<start>if cassie realizes who he is she will forget everything<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewlist-amazinggrace-court-watching-scroll-gif-<end>
<start>nonnn<end>
<start>honestly i do not think everyone is going to remember him for a while but pretty much they are going to stop forgetting and sunny can tell everything<end>
<start>i dare not imagine that of anvil it must be overpowering<end>
<start>each volume<end>
<start>but it is not yet known how an area applies under what condition<end>
<start>yeah but i do when i do<end>
<start>yeah not on that<end>
<start>he is been intriguing me from the beginning<end>
<start>or you will be looping everything from the beginning to each time and you will read the chapters when they come out shibalaugh<end>
<start>or shadow mastery and weaving<end>
<start>i will kill them i will be right back<end>
<start>since the wounds invaded the thing<end>
<start>tessblush<end>
<start>after the trouble with that is that he could not pass supreme naturally as nephis tries to do<end>
<start>i am fine volume<end>
<start>we are going to have to put in a pack of beatings<end>
<start>or he had an inaccessible one in another place because his future of the nightmares died when he had more bodies<end>
<start>i am up to date<end>
<start>see<end>
<start>i keep my promise to myself that is all<end>
<start>the cursed rank is just something too strong for a saint<end>
<start>c is that<end>
<start>she is strong to hide her feelings<end>
<start>be the time has never come between their entry and their exit into the nightmare<end>
<start>just guys i have a question i think i have all mixed bite it is the prince of nothing and when he was in the tower in heaven he was tied in bah why he is present in the valor citadel please<end>
<start>after it is going to jet it coherent its survival<end>
<start>the same nightmare is useless<end>
<start>non catscreen<end>
<start>yes it is true i have an agreement they are glad i am getting to know what better i could not hope more<end>
<start>but rain is carrying the exit leg so i do not see why she could not use or receive ananke memories could use memories while she was a natural wake<end>
<start>at the same time why read her e-mails shibalaugh<end>
<start>i do not know who said it but it was the only one who did not show his power<end>
<start>a little like the titan of the first nightmares and his sun that consumes the souls<end>
<start>there is someone who believes me<end>
<start>she was just talking about the sovereigns<end>
<start>it has no need for more free time but it is sent to areas more dangerous than the other real world while the government concentrates on the world of dreams which is for the most certainty now the threats being managed by the great clans after actually they have had to fight a lot together especially because the girls have tactics and that kai and jet know their combo of weakening the concern resides that they probably did not go to areas with a high concentration of powerful creatures plus door openings with some corrupted creatures so complicated to get memories and moreover they would have to be adapted<end>
<start>so he cannot say it because he is not a mongrel anymore<end>
<start>and flamme to make me feel again at this hour oa<end>
<start>oh okay but like morgan asked no one to marry yet<end>
<start>the return of tbate<end>
<start>it will pass from goat trier because it has the destiny that amplifies its destinee and creates a convergence of the flows around it has a total vacuum or it is a new variable impredictable and unstoppable<end>
<start>moths possible but sunny did not look very hot<end>
<start>and it is got to be one of the strongest at one time or another<end>
<start>nd already<end>
<start>he spent year in the normal world<end>
<start>well he is not dead<end>
<start>it is true what is high enough in the ranking that the<end>
<start>jte leaves the male goat to kai to please you<end>
<start>i am not even sure we are going to have the fight live<end>
<start>or absorbs fragments of corrupt<end>
<start>i am going<end>
<start>jet caster and sleeper without name<end>
<start>because for me without destiny even cassia can no longer see the future of sunny<end>
<start>i love the parallel between him and elfie<end>
<start>mrc for chaps elsewhere<end>
<start>as axel said it is a gov't intermediary<end>
<start>that is why i say weaver's lines are not tied to his brothers<end>
<start>nan he could not improve the dance of shadow is sure but it is not said<end>
<start>yeah but why did not they reset<end>
<start>and the sin of consolation is a memory that i have already seen or not seen<end>
<start>i would have wanted a real confrontation against sunny and the crazy prince after his never-to-be if sunny returns to the tomb<end>
<start>jasminethumbsup<end>
<start>if the dance of the shadow is bound to the exit lege then as it happens that the lantern of the shadow has not disappeared it is a memory created by the exit lege<end>
<start>for me he just ripped out his destiny<end>
<start>we know that this is the bottom that the first wears its appearance he might have been training his hold in tatter<end>
<start>ouiu<end>
<start>the info is on the wiki<end>
<start>i am coming to join you catscream<end>
<start>ah man<end>
<start>lies<end>
<start>i do not think i followed<end>
<start>wow the end of this volume i almost dropped a tear<end>
<start>c actually good<end>
<start>and also mongrel is still alive<end>
<start>ah style was reading again or you just thought about it like that<end>
<start>or<end>
<start>see how he got into the nd maybe he does not need the same row stuff<end>
<start>mongrel good question i think there is tj in collective imagination a bit like the sunny of the film<end>
<start>it would be a shame if suddenly something a little important happened in the life of the same avatar<end>
<start>yes clearly not immediately<end>
<start>even if we have not seen him<end>
<start>ten is or still interesting to read<end>

<start>there is a way and nothing more than to get between his must be a crazy gale<end>
<start>yep it is that perso everything was too fast on the end i stay on my hunger and in lack of so many details of questions by ex genre at the end of chain breaker with hop there had like a dozen that appeared to you in head at the second and you are in mode 'waaaah but keski is going on pepewow' and i was more in mode 'good bah it is done we know what is next there was no emotional shock in me i read from to a blow arrives at about i had the feeling of getting out of the work so little at a time so it was missing things i did not have this feeling of being absorbed in the thing and feeling my heart beating like the dreams of cases by example the tomb of the daemon of the forget for me it could have had a bit more importance but not just it was burying it out of respect of ariel and weaver to cry on his tomb jasminethumbs so it could have had a bit more importance but not just it was burying it out of respect of ariel and weaver to weep on his tomb jasup goodhumbs<end>
<start>i am not sure about this<end>
<start>proba that piaf is the one who laid the egg of the weaving of blood<end>
<start>i have to stop opening this channel<end>

<start>it is good weaver<end>
<start>kai is not the goat right now<end>
<start>it seems to me that the sortlege advances with a cran each step kind of sleepers receive their wake aspect master their essence<end>
<start>sunny always needs a bit of a body bit of no<end>
<start>when even a few hundred chapters before<end>
<start>but she was not finished the last time i read<end>
<start>i am a guignol<end>
<start>jsp it can make a drill thanks to a revelation<end>
<start>but after he speaks less the same<end>
<start>that means they have been from the beginning inside a god<end>
<start>i understand he has a little grudge against asterion too<end>
<start>i hope it is a metaphore<end>
<start>finally real romance mess<end>
<start>no but it has nothing to do with the shadow god huh<end>
<start>in real life i had forgotten jet but it is true that his death is serious possible<end>
<start>in real life the clan of shadow later kind if it develops its can be banked<end>
<start>your brain is fluid<end>
<start>nan ya daemon from the forgotten<end>
<start>it is possible but perso her plan is too crazy for that it would bring her what she would lose sunny bad plan for her also risks getting back to nephis bad plan for her too the others of the cohort like that she would find herself alone sunny can not lie so they would know when he will explain that it is the truth what he says so betraying him again and voluntarily would really be the worst plan for her though she is strong is that within a good cohort she can shine<end>
<start>join us<end>
<start>they will understand that c sunny they will all be shitting themselves<end>
<start>i miss talking in this chanel<end>
<start>how she is panicking<end>
<start>will read catscream<end>
<start>otherwise he may not have a name<end>
<start>he had the advantage of the land<end>
<start>since there is a lot of super monsters in the jungle and they do not even dare to go in<end>
<start>if you need hesite advice<end>
<start>the worst part of it is that the person in question joined the server and also left it<end>
<start>he looks a little fit to be a groove before his habalaaugh<end>
<start>he was half crazy and no longer had the exit leg<end>
<start>already have nothing but the incredible amount of information i have in a quarter of a volume<end>
<start>yeah well his shadows might have gone well since then but they have stagnated enough<end>
<start>on the other hand the reflection he sent to sunny<end>
<start>it is a chad ca jaime<end>
<start>in relation to the debate yesterday and before yesterday yes by killing a sovereign one can appropriate his domain<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmonkey-monkey-dancing-monkey-vibing-monkey-jumping-monkey-vibe-check-gif-<end>
<start>i hate<end>
<start>the period of<end>

<start>we will see all the way real<end>
<start>nan is the channel that can spoil people not linfo<end>
<start>as the exit is spreading<end>
<start>deso<end>
<start>maybe tomorrow<end>
<start>in the end that is what happened<end>
<start>many<end>
<start>and who thought you were talking about my theory<end>
<start>i had planned<end>
<start>go read<end>
<start>he did not have much to do with it level combat style otherwise he recently used it against kai the bad guy with the different shapes he took<end>
<start>well if<end>
<start>plus she is the one who led them to this situation<end>
<start>i think it is kind of like nephis and her domain will pass through the shadows of people<end>
<start>with the discussion on the boat between sunny and mordret<end>
<start>so the sortlege could not have<end>
<start>i swear she is going to scare the suverrain with her surcheat look<end>
<start>i am especially because i do not see row doors there are not enough unclean nightmare creatures to make one or more doors<end>
<start>except that a lot not from the point of view of sunny they met at school<end>
<start>cassie absent chapters and i miss her already<end>
<start>he is the god of death<end>
<start>the only one we know will not surprise me that the one to throw the neph one has gone without her telling us<end>
<start>there is a world or i wait for it to remain that volumes time for me to catch up and get to the day at the end of work this is false i will never hold<end>
<start>if we see her in the same nightmares<end>
<start>a ok my bad<end>
<start>in person<end>
<start>yeah we are finally making a difference<end>
<start>he has regular clients<end>
<start>nan but vrm asterion that of ss he has too much a geule danta finale jai swear<end>
<start>i do not wet myself<end>
<start>i think he will take his mask<end>
<start>she knows how to make a good motivational speech light killer when even shibalaugh<end>
<start>so please sign the toulous ptit duo duponteffie to treat the crowds<end>
<start>for already the daemons who settle in the rs of the gods a little ugly or then it was just aleatory not certain in a mortal kingdom perhaps the islands chained a divine kingdom bastion is one i believe not even stormsea except the earth which was incidentally completely put by side until everyone died ptn<end>
<start>honestly the strongest in history i do not think when you see what does nephis a dusk<end>
<start>i was nice<end>
<start>it seems to me that he says that ct thanks to him that he did not feel alone in his nightmare<end>
<start>interesting nan<end>
<start>ptdr lintro of the sovereign my totally made skip the kiss of sunny and neph the scene is incredible jai adored cbcattoblush<end>
<start>and we do not know how strong it is knowing that the gods are dead<end>
<start>personal i read that the gray trade because i aodize theorise here<end>
<start>in real life it is asterion has divination capabilities and that is how he knows it starts<end>
<start>either they leap into the past years and save the world<end>
<start>the only quote that passes for him is the black one<end>
<start>and then i remind you it is not the same asterion<end>
<start>nothing will destroy sunphis<end>
<start>i think so<end>
<start>you know what<end>
<start>only if it is already with the antarctic distancecontinent their connection was half cut<end>
<start>i am here<end>
<start>a lot of strong nerves to survive<end>
<start>plus jadore les pov de rain<end>
<start>and i quickly stopped<end>
<start>i am on my way<end>
<start>nep is not a nightmare creation<end>
<start>real it is pretty simple g just say that the old sunny has been dead for a long time and or that he had another name and face because we stole his destiny not detried<end>
<start>that sunny is the next seal of the void<end>
<start>given the power he has in addition to being able to hunt in auto mode<end>
<start>it does not make any progress<end>
<start>it is that my opinion but that they come back when the world is completely on the brink of collapse would be dengue<end>
<start>yeah but there is some correspondence even though<end>
<start>a guy almost lambada one of the most powerful saints in the world<end>
<start>cassia iq<end>
<start>or just that i think he is here because it is not too much of the impression that it looks like it is been months<end>
<start>because the seed of the nightmare will do nothing as long as it does not slam<end>
<start>i still remember that feeling of loss ptn by rereading the com that he screen all came back<end>
<start>sah which man sunny<end>
<start>and we know that the sortlege identifies people by their real names<end>
<start>i do not agree with everything but piaf ptdrrr<end>
<start>i voice it well part of the house of the night rather<end>
<start>by passing from cock to lane how asterion is sovereign without domain<end>
<start>he is not smart<end>
<start>the world will discover its value<end>
<start>that is what we all do<end>
<start>he just indicates that the saints rule not anything has envied those of the clans<end>
<start>just because of an edit it is in there and like a jerk i ate the notary<end>
<start>i apologize<end>
<start>i have not seen him in a long time i am waiting for him back<end>
<start>since they entered the real tomb<end>
<start>after that is a little bit the case and i think it is because of this that nephis leaves on such a good base with the new sunny<end>
<start>you do not think you are so good at saying my pretty<end>
<start>like that strove he planted a bomb at sunny's<end>
<start>there is no breaky with her power as a saint who can or i extrapolate and she can only see the person's pov<end>
<start>i am dead<end>
<start>the whole world sleeps on a guy who seals a titan superieur<end>
<start>a nightmare never makes you face your rank a few times<end>
<start>without speech but good<end>
<start>you too my love beast<end>
<start>i am waiting till the end of the v man<end>
<start>what the hell's going on<end>
<start>she wanted a weapon against fate<end>
<start>a guy with huge balls like that i have never seen before<end>
<start>then it is before he goes out with the neph cohort with effie but when exactly jsp<end>
<start>and how you want to prepare for a beast that you have only seen once do not you have no idea of weaknesses and that is just way too powerful<end>
<start>in my opinion the damn impossible since it is a nest<end>
<start>it becomes even more tense<end>
<start>it would be nice at the end to know all that cassie saw on the future in the big lines and at what time<end>
<start>masterclass on masterclass for now is the best flight<end>
<start>an incredible concept<end>
<start>a little sad for missing the end of the nightmare live but otherwise incredible<end>
<start>at the limit she has the shadow weapon<end>
<start>o he might have been a bigger domain but it does not make much sense to him<end>
<start>so corrupt tyrant<end>
<start>i am going to go fishing<end>
<start>dsl gray to correct before<end>
<start>difficult but in v even<end>
<start>the title of the next volume gives desire throne of war ca announces heavy<end>
<start>heaps shibalaugh<end>
<start>bah he is probably the most powerful saint in the world with nephis<end>
<start>on weekdays i am already in volume<end>
<start>guys i really did not get the chap<end>
<start>maybe yes maybe no<end>
<start>i think above all that we have not seen sunny since several chaps and that it is an area where there are fallen but that as by chance groove and tamar have not met any<end>
<start>i will say that his is he can serve as a weapon or sacrifice them to strengthen his power<end>
<start>bahoe<end>
<start>a problem may be<end>
<start>and he just has a method to make her sit down<end>
<start>it is possible that if he recovers are fate everyone forgets the moment or he does not have his own maybe he will not take it back<end>
<start>oh ptn<end>
<start>dm nv chap nan or jsp<end>
<start>when he comes out all the shadows of his soul to make a shabalaugh weapon<end>
<start>he is not wrong<end>
<start>she is really strong<end>
<start>i think he has enough tune to buy the best bed but not on<end>
<start>the fact that the sovereigns must descend makes me think of mythological gods or angels<end>
<start>it would change its aspect in itself<end>
<start>because harus was untouchable<end>
<start>because<end>
<start>yes hutao<end>
<start>it is on the webnovel app<end>
<start>they have access to the name and description of the memory i believe<end>
<start>exactly that<end>
<start>i like it<end>
<start>genre historians and explorers of rdr<end>
<start>stupid question but the trick of having to step back from chapter in you today's trade<end>
<start>he is afraid of her<end>
<start>nephis may seem cold but she will never insult her<end>
<start>perso jy believes in his<end>
<start>it would be so beautiful though cbpray<end>
<start>this is written white on black the<end>
