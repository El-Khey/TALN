<start>additionally superior fleau if they are not happy<end>
<start>so i do not agree<end>
<start>i maintain that sunny should have typed a hook in hop<end>
<start>i do not know pk i feel it effie or kai<end>
<start>kai who is chokbar shibalaugh laughs<end>
<start>so it is powerful enough to swallow everything<end>
<start>i am not sure nephis got bcp of trauma due to antarctica<end>
<start>mordet sovereign theorie several things make me think about its on a tjr seen mordret ascended from rank to rank at the same tps that the rest of the cohort finally it was not at the shore forgets but you maze understood but its does not mean that i see the cohort becoming sovereign for kai effie jet i see not linteret cassie jsp sah of if mordret does not pass underground his would place it more to the rank of subordinate of a sovereign because no one could kill it any more from the level of sunny or neph and can do nothing against them i can think from the principle that he does not know the plan of neph and therefore fights with the domain of the song to kill his father so it would not remain any more than a single sovereign to which he would necessarily be subjected to the queen of worms because no one could kill it any more from his own plane and can do nothing against them i can think from the principle that he does not know the plan of neph and therefore fights with the domain of the song to kill his father so much so that he does not go to the place to the queen of the queen of worm a bit of<end>
<start>that is to say<end>
<start>do not underestimate the capa of jet to kill mordret<end>
<start>i still remember the pressure felt during the climb to falcon scott<end>
<start>you look bcp too informative<end>
<start>i do not know the name the nightmare would have ended before he found it<end>
<start>i think that is the title<end>
<start>she just had to find the crane i think<end>
<start>ah if i think i see<end>
<start>i know that sometimes i eat more information mdr<end>
<start>ptet in collab with him<end>
<start>and i am sure the person in question is also reading these chapters illegitimately is the cherry on the cake<end>
<start>it is not a emptiness creation the black sea<end>
<start>it is really stupid but it must work<end>
<start>for once my memory works eh bh<end>
<start>it is a smooth hair to read dcp jcomprends not too hehe<end>
<start>at least nephis is not the<end>
<start>i know the malice<end>
<start>i felt the embarrassment through the chap<end>
<start>rip<end>
<start>he has the divine aspect of the god of war from what we know but it has not been confirmed<end>
<start>continue like this soldier<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewtapped-on-the-shoulder-lewbert-icarly-se-being-consoled-gif-<end>
<start>on the other hand i do not understand how he can stay worthy of groove has become bigger than him when she is what - years less shibalaugh<end>
<start>bahaha she gets closer to it<end>
<start>tonight is the end of the volume of the coup<end>
<start>let me catch my bro and we do that cbpray<end>
<start>well i am not going to talk too much or it is going to be fun about my lack of knowledge<end>
<start>i will cry<end>
<start>but it could also have become sacred and a door would open only in some years<end>
<start>bcp too precipitous<end>
<start>fun fact we did not have the rain nightmare and i do not see it coming from sitot<end>
<start>i reread the chaps with anemone and i had completely forgotten the mortal kingdoms<end>
<start>i just realized that most of the clocks have ultra-basic capabilities<end>
<start>you write elfie<end>
<start>for me if fate is broken she cannot see in the future<end>
<start>even the way does not the chapter ends on it<end>
<start>me perso is the complete passage not that the part fighting that i hold positive like the tension that there was at that time was crazy<end>
<start>in any way kai has always been too beautiful<end>
<start>it is sunny's betrayal<end>
<start>yes but there is still<end>
<start>it will change then<end>
<start>fielon let him cook<end>
<start>personal i think that with the future domain of sunny everything will change it could be called upon on the ground as we have seen with the other sovereigns who on their domain make little close those that they want like to control the death or make spawn of the million depee<end>
<start>and dcp he would put a mad advance furious to the other sovereign<end>
<start>after he has more time to practice it<end>
<start>of the shady shadow<end>
<start>if ever she is not too far away the real can carrement gets tp beside<end>
<start>without a domain too big of course<end>
<start>i do not know<end>
<start>then there was nothing going on<end>
<start>nan the author he makes us dirty the carrement<end>
<start>not false too<end>
<start>info that comes from the qr of g he said that only sunny neph and mortret had a divine aspect i think that if asterion had one he would just not have answered or just a maybe after that remains information that can change<end>
<start>i find it just the front black quote that could appear long or the rest unbelievable i am going to<end>
<start>god of peace too<end>
<start>one-shotshibalaugh<end>
<start>the citadel<end>
<start>sunny was a holy terror<end>
<start>the horse he never washes<end>
<start>nephis who will start thinking about the practicalspect of having potentially guy at the same time<end>
<start>it haunts me<end>
<start>psq right now he does not regret his decision<end>
<start>they are<end>
<start>especially since it represents a defait of lhumanite lo since sunny has fled so it would be rather logical the rdr milk absorbs<end>
<start>something is blurry<end>
<start>yeah one of my favorite moments from the volume<end>
<start>start of flight<end>
<start>we are going to have to get the singing field biting and we are going to have to rely on you to do some crazy work to catch up<end>

<start>description of nightmare chain memories<end>
<start>oh yeah so short that that the first nightmare and all the way to the fortress<end>
<start>i do not want to think about it<end>
<start>for sunny it corresponds -- first nightmare the unnamed mountains -- the solstice the shore forgets very little sleeper remains more than a year as sleeper -- period as wakes the islands chained most of the wakes remains just in one of the great citadels<end>
<start>a see according to the capacity of neph<end>
<start>i think it is just a mistake because we do not forget him we just forget his name<end>
<start>and that the nightmare appeared on the moon<end>
<start>and seeing that his flight does not consume gasoline he is tempo<end>
<start>jdirais perso<end>
<start>because we are talking about engulfing or consuming but here we are<end>
<start>it is one of the only things that goes back to every revolution<end>
<start>welcome to the drug club no i mean the club from who are up to date you will see its advantage of reading its little chapter in the evening and making theories with the other ohv<end>
<start>plus her daughter was a fan girl of sunny<end>
<start>it is like a minor god<end>
<start>if he is allowed i do not see the other people who do not wake up could not have one as well<end>
<start>since there was a time skip be letat or sunny remained the longest transcendent that so it is well used to its power you think sunny vs a tyrant superieur it little win<end>
<start>well i will tell you again anyway<end>
<start>except asterion<end>
<start>bro we are genies<end>
<start>tro bo<end>
<start>of memory after that would have to check<end>
<start>and one company<end>
<start>would not the moon pass into the world of dreams<end>
<start>of the nightmare<end>
<start>i agree<end>
<start>frankly you are lucky that it went as well in itself mtn you know that you are quiet in addition so in itself benef see the good gray rating for this there are other methods after but good<end>
<start>and butterflies that make several hundred times the volume of your belly<end>
<start>it is a hell of a theory<end>
<start>let me imagine my happy ending<end>
<start>oh ptn i did not understand that there was asterion<end>
<start>sunny did not like him because he looked at nephis<end>
<start>so much more<end>
<start>nan but you see when you say that i realize how much he can cook<end>
<start>oki<end>
<start>strongly the cassy pov to see its reaction and interactions with nephis<end>
<start>but not merge<end>
<start>so we have seen almost everything that is happened<end>
<start>i had not seen omg<end>
<start>small question for you right now is what scene you will prefer in all the work<end>
<start>that is just a bad sign so far she did not let love what she saw<end>
<start>yes i just finished<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbean-mister-bean-mrbean-mr-bean-rowan-gif-<end>
<start>communicator<end>
<start>she was a little too rational<end>
<start>today's sunny did not fuck with fate's strings either and it does not bother him so much<end>
<start>what chicken<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>let neph a sunny<end>
<start>you are lucky then<end>
<start>i make the image of armin in snk but effie is even bigger genre it is the eiffel tower that works<end>
<start>he can literally not he has not the strength already lepee has a more rank than he more an enchantment making him much more resistant<end>
<start>i do not understand<end>
<start>she is not that bad-looking<end>
<start>the bond with nephis worked while it was in a palm hole of the rdr<end>
<start>i wonder how the cohort's going to get a little better<end>
<start>it was to avoid ruining her plan she explained it even by saying the truth it brought too much variable<end>
<start>he likes to give useless but cool information<end>
<start>everything in my title<end>
<start>not current he gets dechire by bit and neph<end>
<start>but the sound apero<end>
<start>my brain smokes too much<end>
<start>but if she dies before the end i am not stupid<end>
<start>after that song it may also be his routine to grab his trone before doing something else shibalaugh<end>
<start>what is the power of the mad prince when he is gone corrupt<end>
<start>and see what the world will give you<end>
<start>serious good good that<end>
<start>hi could a charitable soul give me back the chapter or sunny and cassia splits from the boat in the last volume thank you in advance it is to resume without being spoiled<end>
<start>and even if the domains are fundamentally different they can coexist<end>
<start>but good in my misfortune i find when even a good point i am on vacation for a week<end>
<start>i am going on vacation<end>
<start>i believe he was called oblivion by the dcp comm<end>
<start>yes but it may be indicated the neph of the future with manipulation of the words of the tormentor<end>
<start>i said he did not just create the sortlege but he became it himself by weaving it directly with his soul<end>
<start>yeah battles like that with extra powers would be more interesting<end>
<start>bah dcp nn i do not see the appearance of a master evolute in divine appearance<end>
<start>in it seems to me that mortet had said that his echo mirror that sunny had shot in the chained islands was with him in his first nightmare that lasted a long time no<end>
<start>cormac x<end>
<start>there is no better trauma than lo<end>
<start>it was a titan what already goliath<end>
<start>wow chaps are masterful i do not have the words<end>
<start>especially that best is here<end>
<start>araignee sunny could perhaps use her sons offensively rather than only use them for the memories we already know that they cut super well then in addition if it is a saint who does them it could be super strong<end>
<start>what sunny would do to god grave<end>
<start>sunny who makes bone by solfane<end>
<start>finally<end>
<start>she knows her master is called shadow but does the trio know that the lord of the shadow is also called shadow if they say she can make the link<end>
<start>yeah but sunny said it before all the saints are incredibly strong and talented so it is hypothetical<end>
<start>sunny the landscaper<end>
<start>so you take it back on a base<end>
<start>so maybe she is got it and mtn's more full up<end>
<start>or it is found from the beginning the return of sunny and neph in the tomb was just for a honeymoon<end>
<start>you answer me catscreen<end>
<start>but he will not fight it would compromise his cover<end>
<start>after he may have just been doing his thing for years but his would hurt me a bit<end>
<start>good after that does not explain any more<end>
<start>chapter by mordret<end>
<start>psq a boost on shadows it stinks shit for someone other than sunny<end>
<start>if the real world is integrated into the rdr pas on<end>
<start>i am no more afraid of the death<end>
<start>just we are okay what gave the name of sunny nephis in the hope that it would allow her to leave sunny there and get out of the shore forgets changing her vision<end>
<start>he will test these powers on her<end>
<start>it is not interesting<end>
<start>i wonder what his real name is<end>
<start>it is too hard your thing<end>
<start>my dream is that sunny who wants to defie fate<end>
<start>i would not want to be in her place<end>
<start>the passage of the happy birthday takes place before because he still discusses his temple and how he will manage it<end>
<start>without the sword she is fucked up<end>
<start>normally it is explained in the next chapters<end>
<start>the prophecy speaks of an angel of light being carried away in the shadows<end>
<start>the thing is after taking care of anvil we cannot predict his goal and then submissive he has to give a shit i think the limit would be taking care of asterion but i do not know<end>
<start>we are okay with what is not going to look like before we become a master if she wakes up<end>
<start>i do not even know why i come back to these events<end>
<start>i think it is more like there is stuff that is spawning out of nowhere and we are still talking about an abusing author<end>
<start>you think that is it<end>
<start>yes and it will give an opponent to each<end>
<start>he said that the shadow has reponded or that of all the dead gods only the shadow has reponded<end>
<start>once you are infected with the first nightmare you are sent to the first test if you are a sleeper<end>
<start>stv but i will let you get over it<end>
<start>he really did not expect the shibalaugh<end>
<start>and it is just the components of a human being<end>
<start>in addition to transcendence<end>
<start>not so much<end>
<start>i do not see the development ratio<end>
<start>i am having trouble seeing how it is going to lead to the disappearance of sunny in the typical events mongrel shore cohort forgets are irregular company and the academic works of sunny genre his report of the shore forgets<end>
<start>bah dcp i reponded<end>
<start>whatever happens<end>
<start>good the side of it has recreated the runes of its sortlege etc welp is nice but it gives the impression that nothing has changed in fact dcp<end>
<start>nephis has learned how to handle all the weapons but it is to the epee that she feels most comfortable so yes it can come out of situation and it can surprise an opponent who thinks he knows her so not<end>
<start>olala wa i am shocking info<end>
<start>and after there will be boruslave or borushadow<end>
<start>in real g is really strong to find the capacities that go perfectly to every person like default<end>
<start>or maybe not<end>
<start>your has or has almost exactly that i avoid spoiling<end>
<start>yes vrm<end>
<start>tkt that when you are up to date you will want to do it<end>
<start>moreover the domain of sunny ca could have a connection with its master because for the moment the only advantage of this ability was to be able to increase its master the part reading the information of the master being more a functionality of the sortlege maybe that sunny could have the advantages of the domain of its master and have the same conditions to develop it the desire for nephis the epees for anvil so it will explain the importance of this capacity that is put forward as an advantage not to the taste of sunny<end>
<start>that the shadow bond connects them just but not that there is a master slave relationship if you see what i mean<end>
<start>it depends on what you mean by specifying<end>
<start>for now<end>
<start>may be that it must be seen as a door or connection that connects the divine kingdom before the release<end>
<start>yeah but technically they were not in the tomb but in a re-enactment of the tomb by the sortelege<end>
<start>so that is not it<end>
<start>so maybe the clan of the night only has the god's line<end>
<start>real before so is it all right<end>
<start>her failure is that she always has her aspect of active slashing anything touching her even if it is reduced it seems to me<end>
<start>his we do not know<end>
<start>nan that is because he lost are real name are attached to the world<end>
<start>all right i will let you go i will go back to my great ahujump game<end>
<start>easy<end>
<start>a guy from the nighthouse<end>
<start>i remember the moment tkt is when the gauntlet lifts the creature in the water we agree<end>
<start>there will be more saints<end>
<start>i understood who we were dealing with<end>
<start>and he makes us want to put in place a little thing that hypes us<end>
<start>it wants him to be aware that he would be destiny and that he would continue to search for either he has theorise or he is not out of the control of fate unlikely<end>
<start>sunny as sovereign my god<end>
<start>tkt thank you for the chap you manage<end>
<start>from the chap she fights with an epee if she turns into a phenix it will be guez<end>
<start>a month ago i thought i could not enjoy a webnovel without images and just like the manga<end>
<start>to form a covenant with the house of the night<end>
<start>in this case the cassia has the most chance of dying she arrives at the end of her bow of redemption<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmabay-aykutelmas-temizlik-cleaning-saubermachen-gif-<end>
<start>if i had to do a theory there<end>
<start>i swear to god i am trying but i cannot try to make a hair more relief<end>
<start>so i started<end>
<start>well not actually<end>
<start>yes but i think g presents it to us as the strongest of them since the beginning and will make them top them frame it one can<end>
<start>i think godgrave was already discovered but only by one of the clans and therefore had no great importance<end>
<start>i shocked myself mm when i looked up<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewgundam-wing-bright-slapping-amuro-gif-<end>
<start>so it would be the kingdom of one god and there should be only one line<end>
<start>i wanted to thank him every time<end>
<start>shabalaugh hahaha<end>
<start>omg<end>
<start>because what asked sunny to confirm that it was him who had forgotten<end>
<start>oh yeah i have to get up to date with crazy things that seem to have happened how it happened years ago<end>
<start>the titan dormant beats the impure beast the impure beast beats sunny sunny beats the tian dormant<end>
<start>there is one version or you enjoy more than the other<end>
<start>in any case they will not go back there until the end of the war i think<end>
<start>may be a hair<end>
<start>crazy shibalaugh<end>
<start>technically he was like a boyfriend<end>
<start>yes not false<end>
<start>if j exclude sunny psq cest le prota et cassie psq jsuis in love<end>
<start>yes already in chap i am shocked by the amount of information thank you ananke d'ailleur rests in peace<end>
<start>nop<end>
<start>it remains a sovereign it could be one of its capabilities<end>
<start>bah mordret jle really see as sunny at the beginning on the shore but without default<end>
<start>it makes me feel like i read the chapters after because i cannot say anything<end>
<start>yep everything is relative the v may be making me say that this is ultimately the perfect end for the transition but for the moment no<end>
<start>just a big fuck-up out of the exit leg<end>
<start>for jet we have seen well that she did not have so many superior creatures yet it is she who was most confronted with the dangers by being deployed everywhere when a kai and effie they have been placed as agent among the great clans and we not necessarily had the opportunity to move much more than we can see efficacious to go to the front if we compare this to the group of nephis who malgre to have spent the last years constantly in dangerous areas they have not had many interesting memories adapted to them and yet they have had to kill some creatures in addition as they are attached to the government they have not necessarily access to a lot of memory they are that saints to the government little compare to the domains finally it must be emphasized that they all have characteristics that make that the memories must have some specific effects to be useful enlargement for effie objects intangible for jet and for kai something that would go with its transformation<end>
<start>or skin walker virus caused by a bit of weaver<end>
<start>i could not remember it was like weaver<end>
<start>how she knows it is her owner's body her cells have a tag<end>
<start>but actually yes seen the first chapter of v<end>
<start>when biting lost a reflection he lost a nucleus as when sunny was destroying a shadow on the island of the third nightmare<end>
<start>will read no<end>
<start>at the end of chapter dcp<end>
<start>i will wait for the chap soon enough to resume jpense<end>
<start>wait<end>
<start>i know<end>
<start>only weaver has the power<end>
<start>i think she already did<end>
<start>all the time when i read your messages you hip me so much that i want tryhard but i am afraid not to savour<end>
<start>here is his titan<end>
<start>just more screen time<end>
<start>i am chapter one day i would be up to date<end>
<start>mrc for chaps<end>
<start>but he speaks well of the god forgets<end>
<start>but honestly i do not see a scenario or she beats maree celeste<end>
<start>highest rank<end>
<start>no i get it<end>
<start>i am going to go tkt<end>
<start>- obey<end>
<start>you think nephis is going to fall into fraud<end>
<start>until she reveals her premonitions because otherwise she would know the future of sunny is will not ask her decision<end>
<start>tkt i saw all the illu ahah<end>
<start>we resist<end>
<start>at the end of the painting but i do not think mdrr<end>
<start>also the power of the shadows in which it will make them spawn will influence the expense<end>
<start>there was a name he could have been<end>
<start>the way did not present you the things suggest that it is sunny who will pass it to her<end>
<start>i meant class<end>
<start>sacre jet<end>
<start>he could have said i know more than she does<end>
<start>and then that is why the crazy prince said he cares what you want<end>
<start>yes exactly<end>
<start>it will not be jet<end>
<start>i miss both of them<end>
<start>so yes they won<end>
<start>ahahah same tome he continues to say<end>
<start>in view of its level in weaving anything is possible<end>
<start>soon weaving of the mind i think<end>
<start>if they get to the rank of god yes they will probably be able to do it<end>
<start>but the default is not tied to the exit leg otherwise sunny would have lost his<end>
<start>that is even why sunny trusts much more than a superior monster than a corrupt titan for example<end>
<start>mdr it is going to be weird in one or two when it ends xd<end>
<start>yep the nightmare we are going to have a lot of info to digest i feel it<end>
<start>well they have the shadow bond<end>
<start>chapter in less than a month i did not sleep at night<end>
<start>and we do not even know how it is transmitted<end>
<start>i have just finished the volume of slavic shadow the best volume of novel that i have read in my life very honestly from the beginning to the end this volume will have shown the genie and the talent of guiltythree history takes a terrible turn sunless will never again be the same slavic shadow will never again be the same work this end of volume all especially leaves me personally fruitless from inside what is happening to our protagonist is one of the worst things possible or even the worst in my opinion this last chapter lepilogue let us us see a sunny detache and mastery but above all resolute and firm the ingredients for the birth of the best protagonist of history are my last friends little thing an immeasurable thank you a batman who provides a perfect job yes perfect and who my permit to live fully slavic shadow and this end of volume so if i could give advice to some who pass by here it is to wait and respect the works of gray because they really worth the pain ps i return to weep in my bed i am in pressure i am in pressure<end>
<start>her little bit near her but you will be more in some chapter<end>
<start>so a master against a superior beast is already done but would really have to be called sunless and be a friend with weaver and the god of shadow to do it<end>
<start>but given that the sortlege is in a way a complex weaving certainly not as much as fate but all the same unfathomable it is not likely to depose it<end>
<start>more access to nightmare that are an easy way to climb<end>
<start>euuhhhh<end>
<start>cassie has a sacred aspect nn<end>
<start>let me catch up and i tell you<end>
<start>how this<end>
<start>kai the life<end>
<start>after the current cohort all the valor saints of the epoch<end>
<start>or of the owner<end>
<start>it is easy to read<end>
<start>it is true that transcendent cassia is going to be a sacred delire i am going to keep my mouth shut<end>
<start>do not worry<end>
<start>what are the names of classes in english<end>
<start>so that makes sense<end>
<start>of of ptdrrrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>that is max<end>
<start>and neph tjrs also op<end>
<start>really the biggest masterclass i have ever read even if it hurts<end>
<start>i would not be so sure<end>
<start>i just had stack one chapter i have been up for a while otherwise<end>
<start>the line of the god of the heart is also that of the god of the soul<end>
<start>that is much better yes<end>
<start>his shock after hell<end>
<start>which we cannot help you<end>
<start>i do not know i was not there<end>
<start>i really like fireguards they are amazing<end>
<start>naeve was not the naeve is another character who says it<end>
<start>if the concept of citadel is created by the sortlege how sunny may have taken possession of the temple without name did it not already exist before the sortlege allowing the sovereign to extend their domain even before<end>
<start>lepoque<end>
<start>i think that is ananke talking about it but i am not on tt<end>
<start>after this description my theory stands<end>
<start>the sortlege is bound to destiny but not the reverse<end>
<start>just the exit lege for me<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewelmo-shrug-i do not know-i-do not-know-who-knows-gif-<end>
<start>the tree it has more plot armor than the entire cohort i think<end>
<start>i have been on my tell since week i wanted to put here because it fits so much in the situation of serv mdr<end>
<start>we love gray<end>
<start>but it changes so much in relation to the volume<end>
<start>penguin one day penguin always close this parenthese it is a pass from now on<end>
<start>well nothing then<end>
<start>he must have answered<end>
<start>the chaps are not free it seems to me<end>
<start>and it is cool that as always sunny does not beat the winter beast just like that but that he uses all the means at his disposal to do it<end>
<start>in any case it is good that the author is found a way to explain to us what it is to spend years<end>
<start>since he is out of time<end>
<start>it makes the suspense last<end>
<start>the destruction of the world<end>
<start>because the bond is simply a thread of destiny that connects them<end>
<start>yeah when i say i am talking about the shore forgets perso<end>
<start>bah normally not fine in principle the nephis relatives were saints and she is born human so if it is her first nightmare i will say more that he is a little like nephis who succeeds a seed by being just a awakening<end>
<start>well at the same time if he cannot find them we do not have a story<end>
<start>he does not deserve it anyway<end>
<start>a nice person gives me his account so that i have access to the chapters of vo<end>
<start>mdrrrr what is the principle mdr<end>
<start>yep i am going to catch up first<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewsweats-gif-<end>
<start>t not pret shibalaugh<end>
<start>it makes me think a lot about a loki stroke during the ragnarok this formulation<end>
<start>godgrave sun<end>
<start>nope x<end>
<start>i think especially of those who did research<end>
<start>i also think of a new evolution of the master attribute of the shadow<end>
<start>we see it because it did not disappear after the loss of the exit leg<end>
<start>and as soon as it starts it ends directly<end>
<start>xd<end>
<start>we will have a party tonight<end>
<start>yeah but that is because he got the weaver line<end>
<start>ah bah just jet it is probably the most deadly saint<end>
<start>with groove<end>
<start>most likely<end>
<start>they say it is who<end>
<start>and more<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewluffy-one-piece-anime-crying-gif-<end>
<start>a harem so late in history seems unlikely and especially useless<end>
<start>and the kiss that comes out of nowhere amazing<end>
<start>well she must have the seed so yes<end>
<start>kind of daeron probably had an aspect related to water so an authority on it but that is not the capacity of its domain<end>
<start>i do not hope after as it is at the time of becoming a master who discovers his default aspect<end>
<start>chelou the visible link between the prince of nothing and the nothingness<end>
<start>i cannot get the chap out anymore but i think nephis mainly blames the sovereign because they gave up as a gunlaugh<end>
<start>i am too smart tavu<end>
<start>if ever morgan or mortret would kill anvil you think it could automatically pass supreme and recover their father's domain<end>
<start>that probably explains later<end>
<start>anemone c is the island of you all this loop repete c is ca<end>
<start>on<end>
<start>but yes<end>
<start>we will know more when he can inspect nightmare capabilities again<end>
<start>i do not understand the chap is called the princes of the universe<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>and with that they could gain the help of government members who are known to be friends with nephis<end>
<start>there is something i had to zaper again<end>
<start>i hope<end>
<start>i will hold the nephis<end>
<start>the only one that seems unconnected to a daemon by its concept is also that of the shadow that seems to bind to a god<end>
<start>he did not look hot in the direction he was going to find the piaf<end>
<start>but less devotion<end>
<start>its attributes and appearance have not disappeared nan<end>
<start>c true<end>
<start>he had not sacrificed his nuclei to create transcendent reflections<end>
<start>jcrois even they can become transcendent without appearance<end>
<start>or with the sight of a powerful guy<end>
<start>well it is better than my humble opinion it is not necessarily a gift<end>
<start>it was my preference for a serious mdr<end>
<start>the exitlege allows to get them<end>
<start>the third nightmare you know about it is towards her chap<end>
<start>the lines of other daemons are not prohibited by the fact<end>
<start>when he pops in front of falcon scott<end>
<start>i admit it is frustrating when you know the xd suite<end>
<start>his body in the real world was destroyed<end>
<start>get out of here and spoil yourself catscreen<end>
<start>the same is a crazy thing<end>
<start>at the same time cassie merite maybe a little shibalaugh because she did not say a nephis just to scratch - memory a sunny shibalaugh<end>
<start>i think so too<end>
<start>i do not know why he is been out the last time<end>
<start>too much question<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewrock-one-eyebrow-raised-rock-staring-the-rock-gif-<end>
<start>prdrrrr nan i saw the name i did not understand mdrrr<end>
<start>honestly i think sovereign is enough<end>
<start>sunny already had galler to kill the crab when he had memory nephis fleau sup<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>we feel it is an easy stain<end>
<start>mdrr it is about mortret<end>
<start>so here we go<end>
<start>i would have to read it again but there was not something like that on the ashes<end>
<start>thank you<end>
<start>in any case i trusted in g he will find the perfect shape for him if he says his transfo just listens to him essence mtn i would be sad<end>
<start>guys i have a question asterion it is the ruler of the house of the night<end>
<start>especially that he managed to keep some memories even after his corruption combo he would have had no chance<end>
<start>bah almost how years compared to the ratio of number of wakes since the creation of the dream kingdom only by counting the real world and not the other people i would say that if knowing that it is the only one that is known with the line of weaver and a daemon more globally<end>
<start>yeah but it would not have been the same end if it were shibalaugh<end>
<start>because at this moment sunny would have chosen himself to stay in this situation he would have been slaved that by name by the link more sunny also wanted to break fate as cassia and he must see things on it that either me because i am not a day or everyone because it did not come out we did not know about it<end>
<start>but in the end i am more sure to call him that<end>
<start>to see the good side of things g will suck his mind to come back better<end>
<start>but sunny he does not wash bcp either<end>
<start>you just made me think of something<end>
<start>deeply the end of the nightmare that jreaks and jenchaine the last chap<end>
<start>on the other hand i believe that the saints of the lepoch are undervalued by madness<end>
<start>but i really think it is when you look at her<end>
<start>we did not get the right to follow the bee story<end>
<start>he is not taking a break<end>
<start>i have more for a very long time until i am up to date and i avoid a maximum of reading in the channel i just share my opinions and after i resume my reading<end>
<start>but it is going to get complicated<end>
<start>when i read this kind of message i am happy<end>
<start>bah like his himself of the future was a transcendent he might have been there to take advantage of it to kill the bird after he stole his fate from the pass after i did not understand if he really was a saint or if it was a lie<end>
<start>this end of volume is dantesque<end>
<start>especially when she talked about it to sunny she looked hopeless and afraid as if she doubted<end>
<start>or i am back<end>
<start>we do not question your theory her just ya too much black dot in your theory that are not logical<end>
<start>that is trkl then wsh<end>
<start>bad living room jcrois<end>
<start>for me weaver was master of what happened until the moment he freed himself<end>
<start>they come out<end>
<start>even the sighs laughed in front<end>
<start>so no evolution since the nightmare<end>
<start>that is not true<end>
<start>it is because she is a divine memory<end>
<start>if i do not say fuck her mother dies in the chapter or the fact that cassie was weird with her mother<end>
<start>any comment<end>
<start>obel<end>
<start>but he would be too scared<end>
<start>a memory twilight there are two three things yes<end>
<start>sunny has become the old wise man who runs the store or unites the heroes and who is actually much more powerful than we think and who knows much more than the other genres has the tokyo ghoul yoshimura or a dragon ball muten roshi<end>
<start>in addition to the fact that he has no names shibalagh<end>
<start>i know them<end>
<start>hi little question is that already ray<end>
<start>and also the mad prince<end>
<start>can be with stronger weaving and anchor in reality<end>
<start>though in reality i see him badly being a god but more righteous of divine rank<end>
<start>but it is true that having met no creations of the nightmare except - not very strong it is strange in this region<end>
<start>we know that mordret can take possession of the nightmare monsters<end>
<start>you cannot say he is got a chance after you read ajd's chaps<end>
<start>but when mm in years the others have not progressed so much<end>
<start>the more the right to come out of something mentions once in the same line of chap mtn canny<end>
<start>it will hurt me too much if one of them dies<end>
<start>be it already seen but not long<end>
<start>a superpowering guy who calls himself the lord of shadows and lives alone in a hyper-dangerous area<end>
<start>and i found her already heavy<end>
<start>really i have never read such an amazing story<end>
<start>i thought it was the dream god<end>
<start>bah basically it is the agreement to post the en version of the work i had put it in the name of wn since the site had pleased him with the operating method also so basically it is not i who have the right to translation but you x<end>
<start>they have not had any interaction before so i do not think so much less a mention of her i think<end>
<start>reopen your shop what else<end>
<start>if you are told more you are going on a major spoil of the volume<end>
<start>there is only the one who is first indisputable in my top<end>
<start>it is the name of the same god you forgot<end>
<start>rdv in not long then nephis<end>
<start>true<end>
<start>wait for fielon c a supreme bow<end>
<start>and in the nightmare is what damaged the chiane breaker<end>
<start>even if i think it is me i am going to do justice tomorrow for saying it laughs<end>
<start>killing a saint by being a master was not enough for him<end>
<start>he would never dare take us out<end>
<start>pray with all your soul and mind<end>
<start>yura anvil and morgan in the same place he will make a genocide ptdrrrrr<end>
<start>so by expansion shadow has a relation to the neant<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewboss-mullet-legend-happy-vacation-gif-<end>
<start>he just will not get the rewards he can even advance in mastery no<end>
<start>slavic shadow peak especially when he killed people with rock<end>
<start>after that he was not an important spoiler he just thought it was already over but it is up to him to be careful<end>
<start>thank you<end>
<start>indeed it may need to warm up a little before<end>
<start>the one who gave him the drop dichorn i believe<end>
<start>a or<end>
<start>and it is also interesting to know that if she comes from a memory of a line cn is not anvil that gets her but her parents<end>
<start>he is one shot of the superiors mdr<end>
<start>after what exactly jsp<end>
<start>js that c mortet but jy do not believe perso<end>
<start>assuming that weaver is a good guy<end>
<start>you can be sovereign without a domain already you are just less powerful<end>
<start>it is not just the temporal temple that screwed up<end>
<start>did i say otherwise<end>
<start>yeah super coherent the spectator and everything but it would have been a beautiful exit door<end>
<start>a row below corrupt<end>
<start>sleeping is very weak<end>
<start>all turn them over his mental detruct<end>
<start>no joke<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewissou-drole-marrant-rire-rigoler-gif-<end>
<start>may be in his domain with a sick prepa and advantageous circumstances but yeah never of life as a saint he would go back<end>
<start>you are going to make me believe what was not aware that sunny was going to choose that<end>
<start>or it partially passes through for now more logical for just a corrupt terror<end>
<start>exact as sonhaon said it concerned parts of the sunny life before the loss of fate for that she forgot them<end>
<start>mddr imagine he asks to be freed from destiny and from the blow nephis dies from a heart attack to death note<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>if tkt shibalaugh<end>
<start>a dead man will no longer be ashamed of valor<end>
<start>cassie who has the right to have a memory of sunny who goes crazy again and starts insulting herself luck<end>
<start>rain is not a bearer of the sortlege of the nightmare she will rise by the natural way ananke is also a natural wake but she is prestressed of the exitlege it must be for that she can use memories<end>
<start>valor has the advantage of having the lord of shadows and the temple without name of its side it can make a difference i think<end>
<start>sunny and cassie who will break the century<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewvery-hot-high-temperature-thermometer-fire-summer-gif-<end>
<start>we have the information that the daemons died the gods yes it is sure but at any time yen has a pop<end>
<start>i have always seen him like that<end>
<start>on the other hand is that there is no possibility that in previous cycles it is constantly had this choice to make a wish<end>
<start>the devil of imagination i am eager to see what he will give<end>
<start>httpsdiscordcomchannels you will better understand my message which is partly biased now but the bottom remains the same<end>
<start>besides that was what the story of the terror of sunny was about a blue sky without limits and falcon scott<end>
<start>the goat will hit again for this second half of work so<end>
<start>the sortlege that has fun spom kill of sleeping a godgrave<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrr<end>
<start>and for valor bah certainly anvil a carrier but it makes sense since he is there to implement his plan<end>
<start>main reasons<end>
<start>that you have finished<end>
<start>seeing that for rain c is just a stupid story<end>
<start>must also take into account that the weaving talent of the mad prince is really immense can be thanks to the transformation<end>
<start>or both<end>
<start>that is for sure<end>
<start>woaah my brain is smoking<end>
<start>cassie my queen remembers sunny she probably saw her in the future explains to her who he was it is her affinity with the revelations<end>
<start>if asterion were sacred there would be a big door lvl<end>
<start>or else it passes another way<end>
<start>in real sound default it could be that he cannot create perfect depee or that he is never satisfied with what he creates<end>
<start>but then someone knows because there is one of them who died in the black quote and the other we do not know where he is<end>
<start>i doubt it but sunny is the goat the frerot he kills saints by being master<end>
<start>and you are more powerful<end>
<start>we must wake up<end>
<start>when you are going to be out you are going to squeeze<end>
<start>prohibited<end>
<start>you are actually playing shifumi with the creations of the nightmare<end>
<start>so the theory said that asterion had a divine aspect<end>
<start>and so the ananke coat is staying because it has an enchantment like that<end>
<start>the cassie church is launched that of the true deesse<end>
<start>it is because he went with sunny<end>
<start>not stupid<end>
<start>when he is going to have to pretend to be a caster sucker<end>
<start>pcq there are many problems with chapters on illegal sites<end>
<start>when you read from one of you<end>
<start>seeing as you know yourself<end>
<start>then i am not sure it is actually exactly the same moment for the three it is mostly for the stage i think<end>
<start>oe mdrr<end>
<start>god forgets he died like he broke into fragments of stars who made daemons<end>
<start>o they are possible<end>
<start>we are running late<end>
<start>i do not think sunny regrets being in the estuary<end>
<start>i was talking about it when i said i did not understand why she was doing it<end>
<start>so sunny is a kind of psychic dead angle even when you turn you do not see your back but you can visualize it i think it is the most coherent way and that keeps the most incoherence<end>
<start>thank god<end>
<start>true question<end>
<start>i do not think we know<end>
<start>not at all<end>
<start>other daemon no info<end>
<start>moon be like<end>
<start>i think this is going to end badly<end>
<start>you can go out and read<end>
<start>you are right i am checking<end>
<start>i was fine<end>
<start>effie and kai are the most likely<end>
<start>he is probably going to get it back or something<end>
<start>pq have a cassy effie club fan when you have a snake that can imitate them<end>
<start>i am pretty much in agreement with you but the point is if we are talking about authority it has to have something to do with supremacy<end>
<start>and you come for the best time<end>
<start>we can make a book of audio<end>
<start>in real life i think it is going to be a flashback on a potential fight against the greedy ladies<end>
<start>in real g must have been tired of shitting him with romance in ss<end>
<start>c sure<end>
<start>there is none other than the sister's biting with divine lines<end>
<start>big brain<end>
<start>oh but i am fucking wrong<end>
<start>i have to find another webnovel of ideas<end>
<start>if we go away like this it will get dirty<end>
<start>or fate<end>
<start>it is all about riding crescendo<end>
<start>so it will reach the third rank of the nirvana of divine primordial chaos<end>
<start>on the other hand the triple fight can be really funny<end>
<start>but the<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewexactly-jack-donaghy-rock-alec-baldwin-precisely-gif-<end>
<start>do not hit me here too<end>
<start>i guess it is something like social center north quarter<end>
<start>maybe a tyrant if there is bcp<end>
<start>yeah really like he looks like he is talking to the cohort but what the fuck is that sounding wrong in a way i am thinking it is about he is already ahead of it and he is been manipulating them all the time even though he is in the worst situation he is got that power to make you doubt everything he is too strong<end>
<start>on the shore forgets i have no name<end>
<start>psq means if he ever masters this thing<end>
<start>she was distant because she knew when she died<end>
<start>then little question the sunny of the future we see it in the tomb because left a trace in it but es that when our sunny will go in it we will see its version of the pass because even if we see it in a nightmare the tomb is so bizzar that it is possible especially that daeron's tear is in it well whatever goes into a nightmare<end>
<start>we do not want to know<end>
<start>the mad prince is too smart<end>
<start>it stinks the next chapter it is going to be i can find out about people by looking at them i found out it was your birthday or something like the end of the dream<end>
<start>the corruption has probably started before their fall and then the kingdom of dreams is according to the explanation of anemone the other central worlds like the earth or the world of origin of anemone are lied worlds but not on the same 'plan' of existence according to how i see it persono and the kingdom of dreams following corruption absorbs the worlds eg the doors of the nightmare that open it is the world of dreams not the sortlege that creates them a contrario of nightmares<end>
<start>name of v game of throne<end>
<start>well we cannot buy on webnovel<end>
<start>in sah<end>
<start>i remember<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbig-trouble-if-i-speak-if-i-speak-i-am-in-big-trouble-speak-big-gif-<end>
<start>apaimoncookies<end>
<start>oh well yeah still<end>
<start>i finished the volume<end>
<start>already he should be having a second<end>
<start>i do not think so either but you never know<end>
<start>it is obliged to do its utmost to express a truth<end>
<start>he can always kill awakens with powers related to shadows<end>
<start>on the other hand i have two-three questions because i have a memory hole or it had not yet been explained - at the time of the war between the daemons and the gods the dream kingdom had already consumed the other kingdoms or not yet - godgrave had been discovered during the four years of ellipse or it was already known long before because i find it strange that we did not have a single mention before the flight<end>
<start>jador<end>
<start>a beast superior died<end>
<start>ptn he is really lucky he is next<end>
<start>he will be even better<end>
<start>she had the mask but one row below<end>
<start>really small<end>
<start>well she told her that for the moment<end>
<start>c the purpose<end>
<start>and if not enough time to start over the third nightmare of a trafficking<end>
<start>c good hype<end>
<start>when he has a new level<end>
<start>for bite<end>
<start>without hot head a little<end>
<start>for me newspapers is the most likely<end>
<start>i am not sure he picked the right person<end>
<start>even if it is true that<end>
<start>there are so many ptit details hiding like this in larc it is too good<end>
<start>well there is already some<end>
<start>naaaaaaaaaaaaaaan<end>
<start>at the same time<end>
<start>as long as the person does not care yes<end>
<start>it is ireel<end>
<start>sunny who realizes that he may not be so rich as that shibalaugh<end>
<start>because it will surprise me that caster is asking for an anvil<end>
<start>i pray<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>it is a crazy thing what he does to us<end>
<start>imagine inviting anvil to make a shibalaugh picnic<end>
<start>guess shibalaugh<end>
<start>well she did not have the cores of something to wake up to get her ass together<end>
<start>sunny says it in both chap yesterday<end>
<start>i do not know how it is but asterion was just more dangerous for it<end>
<start>there is an efy clown<end>
<start>i have tears coming to me<end>
<start>there are times of volume or i would have wanted to have qq fight<end>
<start>it is really the emotions<end>
<start>i think above all that the evolution of sunny did not make itself felt as she saw it regularly<end>
<start>bah in real life if someone arrives to destroy the sortlege it is that he managed to create a being powerful enough to surpass it so the goal of the sortlege would be fulfilled so no need of the sortlege<end>
<start>at least one death cohort rating is required to compensate<end>
<start>really for me it is to see yourself for me ss will stop here it is the biggest possible banger that happens but perso i do not see him yet<end>
<start>yes she did<end>
<start>jpars from the principle that cassie has captured something in connection with sunny the happy birthday was too weird so if the passage between nephis and shadow rolled out after the potential awareness of cassie it would not make too much sense given the behavior of saif cassie if she still pretends while if nephis vs shadow rolled out before the scene of the happy birthday then may be that the encounter with shadow helped cassy in one way or another has remembered sunny<end>
<start>guys i stopped chap thinking i am going back now or i am waiting for the<end>
<start>it would be a little contradictory if you had some ice in the desert<end>
<start>yeah okay because i thought it was weird that they were all in the last few years and not before<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewamount-attract-attractive-attracts-aura-gif-<end>
<start>we cannot know until we know how to transmit a line<end>
<start>there was no advantage<end>
<start>yeah it is going to be short in the story<end>
<start>no need to say more<end>
<start>or nan agreement just aloud<end>
<start>unless cassia goat comes to find a way to remember her<end>
<start>i was breaking up<end>
<start>you think people will know he is hiding his real name<end>
<start>yeah the purpose of the release is to allow people to wake up much faster and easily but everything the release does is possible without<end>
<start>she is got a lead<end>
<start>well but in fact the messages you sent are contradictory<end>
<start>i love how sunny lashes crazy like this too<end>
<start>mrc<end>
<start>there is definitely a guy down there to get to him<end>
<start>the dingz it would be<end>
<start>c is like hot<end>
<start>but kind largely not comparable to a sovereign nephis or sunny<end>
<start>oh no ss tonight<end>
<start>morgan who quietly returns home will see her father next and the cohort become transcendent she will depress<end>
<start>in real life with a max of preparation and an advantage over titan genre it is weak facing the shadow asks me not how c possible but imagine i think it is possible<end>
<start>he had lines of dialogue at the same time ptdrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>so the bird ripped off the link between sunny and the exitlege<end>
<start>sunny and nephis it starts with stalkage<end>
<start>spoiler<end>
<start>i think more like she tryhard tt the hoodie she is on the cane pts and he spawn<end>
<start>and the arrogant on the contrary i am modest i think the figh will be banger sah<end>
<start>your steps still ready<end>
<start>see that there is a variable<end>
<start>ptdrrrrr it is true that he can do anything to him he is totally invisible<end>
<start>he is different he is born in while nephis nan<end>
<start>well i confess that from the moment your father gives you back to a buddy as a currency exchange against an unknown service there is no need much more for the hate shibalaugh<end>
<start>since sunny seemed to regret her decision<end>
<start>- x -<end>
<start>there is a chap tonight<end>
<start>i think so too<end>
<start>the only advantage<end>
<start>and asterion heard about it at the same time as everyone<end>
<start>she even created her serie and her drama so tired of seeing nephis alone and she really had popcorn<end>
<start>arc fan service<end>
<start>thanks<end>
<start>what an idea to see humans in real life<end>
<start>she did not know what she was going to forget but left a word saying run to see a certain sunless i would like to believe what was not on but to say what was not on the record this is just the wrong time<end>
<start>there is also him<end>
<start>it is mostly that asterion supreme it seems a little weak if it has to become the antagonist after the other sovereigns<end>
<start>but the c thing that we know he is going back to the pyramid as a suverrain with nephis so be it he goes back to the bottom to kill the bird and picks up his destiny would mean that he would have between tps found a solution for sallie to the monk with neph be it will find a solution between tps<end>
<start>i do not see who she could talk about shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>that it is not fixed rather<end>
<start>the sunphis is here heee's back<end>
<start>all the humans in the rdr are dead<end>
<start>to take care of his restaurant on<end>
<start>my guess is that the cohort will have more<end>
<start>i do not know<end>
<start>cursed terror<end>
<start>but it is frustrating when it is still<end>
<start>the only member of the cohort who cannot die right now is kai<end>
<start>you are not the only one<end>
<start>if taimes suffer i suppose yes mdrrrrrr<end>
<start>i come to see theories and then i am used to coming sometimes is that i click on it without doing expres x<end>
<start>sunny who reveals his default in the nd nightmare<end>
<start>i do not know what day you are talking about<end>
<start>this is your time<end>
<start>she forgot but thanks to her the she realized she forgot<end>
<start>i think what will never die<end>
<start>ah bah speaks more mdr<end>
<start>who knows how to bite does not seem to have the war line<end>
<start>i hope sunny goes out to tell her<end>
<start>as if we believed it was important<end>
<start>i think average ya we have a pov groove in not long dcp<end>
<start>that she dies<end>
<start>he is not going to do anything anyway<end>
<start>or something to know asterion<end>
<start>maybe a divine-looking holder<end>
<start>sunny morgan one of the best too<end>
<start>yes but i will find it abusing to change its appearance to the point of making the shadow bond obsolete<end>
<start>i hope he is not too soon to act<end>
<start>he is really gone to die his eyes<end>
<start>the same world is the kingdom of dreams and there will surely be no more than worlds<end>
<start>moreover i fell back on a chapter we did not have news about the architecture of greystone idem for the third archonte wandering or even the universal origin of rituals<end>
<start>a coach is not on the field at last<end>
<start>not false shibalaugh<end>
<start>gg heap theory is confirmed<end>
<start>but in any case the fight and more interesting than i would have thought<end>
<start>just to piss off<end>
<start>hard<end>
<start>i do not know what to wait for<end>
<start>but otherwise sunny calling weaver of sdf is magistral shibalaugh<end>
<start>after impossible that sunny and neph hunt the cursed tyrant it would bring sunny too close to the bird thief<end>
<start>i do not see why it would not be possible even if i do not see too much groove with a divine line<end>
<start>mdr imagines he screws up and starts all over again from the beginning<end>
<start>happily he will never become holy<end>
<start>in real life i understand your feedback i had the same reaction<end>
<start>i have had a good time<end>
<start>her friend agent and maybe a girlfriend here it is okay<end>
<start>to see what it will give in real life<end>
<start>it is no better to put your question here httpsdiscordcomchannels<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewshake-hand-handshake-agree-deal-nice-to-meet-you-gif-<end>
<start>already they are people who do not have a strong interest in death like we are not going to be especially sad or what<end>
<start>how that a day but the author had written them in advance he did not write chapter a day when even<end>
<start>and we know honestly who if there is one guy in the cast who can kill sunny it is well bitten and vice versa<end>
<start>even if it seems a little logical<end>
<start>and who will not understand<end>
<start>so if the rain makes its first nightmare with the power of a sleeper seeing a wake it is the jackpot<end>
<start>except that it does absolutely not shame to valor it is even much more useful alive<end>
<start>as bono said the shadow is a component of a person<end>
<start>that is how i understood it<end>
<start>so as soon as she has the confirmation of sunny it is loss of memory and without direct confirmation it is okay thanks<end>
<start>weaver it is pretty much a fate that is already trace while nether it is destiny what is rather a destiny that creates itself with the choices that we make<end>
<start>well i have got stuff to do this afterm so little chance i am past the chapter today<end>
<start>you can<end>
<start>yes that is right<end>
<start>the name of the<end>
<start>sunny who takes the place of sunny of the future who returned to the pass while he had invaded the previous passes taking the place of sunny of the future<end>
<start>makes sense<end>
<start>it is rather the dance of the shade which must increase to the maximum the rank of sunny is sufficient for the winter bete<end>
<start>admissible argument i say<end>
<start>it is better like that<end>
<start>tyx for chaps<end>
<start>seeing that he is only a divine shadow<end>
<start>i am finishing part two<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewaroojtwt-gif-<end>
<start>i know more if i have already said it but with yesterday's nephis chaps looks like bcp more a hop than the god of fire<end>
<start>ah but yes that is the worst thing i have felt in my life at the level of the novels this frustration ptn supercrygenk<end>
<start>jcrois<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewkoda-bat-gif-<end>
<start>after a moment<end>
<start>anyway i am waiting for the new chapter<end>
<start>if not<end>
<start>what is going on<end>
<start>i just read the idea that he had with the shadows in his mommy<end>
<start>his hatred of his father is to pass after he has become awakened and to be going to meet him but we do not yet have the details to pass him but his moment when biting has had a visceral hatred for his family i am just waiting for a flash back to know if he is passing her<end>
<start>it is their divine<end>
<start>i am a man free from his barriers<end>
<start>on the wiki is brand it is transcendent so i bug<end>
<start>i do not think it is enough to look carefully<end>
<start>their relationship before faster when they do not know each other<end>
<start>tears of happiness tkt nothing else<end>
<start>until the end of the nightmare yes<end>
<start>sunny and biting against cassia and nephis<end>
<start>we were lucky on this one i think it could have ended very badly with webnovel directly<end>
<start>at the end of the volume when it discovers its capacity<end>
<start>it is just the odds of having the whole of the cohort's pov nightmare that would have been really cool and also to see yards it was expected when even<end>
<start>well not necessarily<end>
<start>yes but it is not confirmed<end>
<start>azy i am going after the thrill<end>
<start>basically the vision that had been broken at the beginning or she was talking about an angel being eaten by shadows represented the fight between neph and sunny<end>
<start>draw your own path<end>
<start>even if she was not on her had a clear idea of what might probably happen or she would not have warned herself but yeah it might have changed nothing but well she could have told her when she even left to make a big speech in mode oh no ny we would not be sad<end>
<start>here you go with me<end>
<start>i do not remember though<end>
<start>oh yes<end>
<start>ah but of course no one rivals sunny neph or bites v<end>
<start>okay i thought he was in there right now<end>
<start>i think he is more connected to thinking as an intermediary<end>
<start>the fight against the superior creation the cross of the hollow mountains we see that it is very strong this<end>
<start>you do not even know<end>
<start>we do not think anymore<end>
<start>read in real life is good<end>
<start>mdr he is going to get popped<end>
<start>there is been a lot of things going on in this living room in the night<end>
<start>hi the versions on amazon are published by webnovel so g wins well part of what you think but i do not advise you to buy this the cutting of chapters is terrible if you want to support it it it is better to take a subscription on webnovel i think exit a side download a pirate version of the volumes with a good cutting book genre that makes volume instead of book made chapter without taking into account the real volume<end>
<start>you will see the<end>
<start>maybe he discovered something after the shore forgets<end>
<start>but it is going to speed up the<end>
<start>i cannot tell you more<end>
<start>just for that the second reason is actually a very good ideae shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>i wonder what crazy g's going to get us out of here<end>
<start>well seen '-' the cans on the same black background and are glued mb<end>
<start>neither do i end like that<end>
<start>ever i could wait chapter to be just a day en shibalaugh<end>
<start>they are talking<end>
<start>way<end>
<start>you think<end>
<start>after i think it says that even among the saints it is incredible<end>
<start>the end of nightmare she will be ruining i think<end>
<start>sunny becomes more and more annoying to each gap too and if it is accompanied by a good group it can do it<end>
<start>i do not know because the power of a sovereign comes from his domain and i do not know if several domains can be confused like that exist in the same place if it is not the case how they would go to develop their domain knowing that nephis and probably sunny will have theirs even if there is any other advantage that the domain would not necessarily be hyper advantageous compared to the risk i think but logically they will want to progress so i imagine they will do it even when<end>
<start>plus there is even no gacha it is not funny it is not a game or i can lose all my money on a stroke of catscreen head<end>
<start>i do not see that it is all my name at the moment<end>
<start>but then it will have to start a new work as well<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfildrong-pokcamon-youtube-terrible-dcasillusion-wneua-gif-<end>
<start>something of the kind chosen from the shadows<end>
<start>no<end>
<start>yup i was thinking<end>
<start>besides those who read that in french do not know the sadness of seeing that you have only one chapter ajd and tomorrow<end>
<start>why the wounds even exist<end>
<start>after yes his sure that his plays something at the domain level<end>
<start>a spa<end>
<start>there is a confrontation where the light gets eaten by the tenebres -- sunny beating nephis<end>
<start>what might happen at some point<end>
<start>in any case the next one is announced masterclass i wonder if sunny will interact with the sovereign<end>
<start>but nobody talks about the superior titan who has despawn<end>
<start>depairge<end>
<start>it can be more like a snake<end>
<start>she would have been honest<end>
<start>knowing that the bird thief has left a terrible terror special<end>
<start>well i definitely expected that neph and the cohort would succeed but the fact that the first researcher and his state would have cut down the mood of the rod in the fight against the first researcher i would have liked to see it<end>
<start>clearly<end>
<start>guys<end>
<start>i had not seen ptdrrrrrr<end>
<start>nan there is his uncle the saint with whom he killed '' the sirene''<end>
<start>in real life now that i think about it we can see the thing of both ways<end>
<start>it is the sunny theory but so joining mine weaver would have done that to stop it just so i want to go further i can even say that the divine aspects are there to choose the next god and raise them up in order to replace the dead gods to re-seal corruption x<end>
<start>he can already transfo he is a pain in the ass to find him a new form<end>
<start>catscreen<end>
<start>yeah not stupid but it happens that the sovereign song moves<end>
<start>and for the second<end>
<start>but prefer the one above<end>
<start>we just know he has the line of the god of the heart<end>
<start>yeah after that remains my perso interpretation of the staging actually<end>
<start>hop since i have nitro<end>
<start>but we know she is here<end>
<start>join the fan club<end>
<start>but if it is a permanent space there is more chance that it is the domain<end>
<start>that his relationship with sunny strengthens<end>
<start>yes but he does not use them all as well if<end>
<start>but in this case the why cassie forgot some parties on their reunion with the good birthday<end>
<start>no i do not think valor will send him to the front if he wants to go to the front he can use this excuse but it will be mostly to be with nephis and observe him<end>
<start>you guys will never believe me<end>
<start>it is already pounds a year<end>
<start>when you said about goliath closing his eye to the moon<end>
<start>not necessarily<end>
<start>the return of my great person here<end>
<start>because yes she saw further than the same<end>
<start>httpsdiscordcomchannels pay attention to those who are today queen francais it can spoil<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthanos-thano-marvel-snapped-gauntlet-gif-<end>
<start>so it is a lot more or less unique to sunny but other people can<end>
<start>i am really starting to think it is becoming a drug<end>
<start>efuse a ray of sun in our cyou are<end>
<start>he must have too much anvil seum the only epee he liked he got stolen<end>
<start>if it destroys a nucleus the shadow that is with it will also be destroyed<end>
<start>as the other said you have to pay attention to what you want<end>
<start>neph talking about it and saying something to sunny like not to talk about it in public or something<end>
<start>queen's medicine<end>
<start>a translator brings added value that apps cannot bring<end>
<start>after all i knew her with so<end>
<start>we see it in the second nightmare in the arena<end>
<start>there is even no need to talk<end>
<start>i cannot see how much i am doing against her<end>
<start>his seems possible but must vrm a max of preparation i think<end>
<start>when sunny is going to find snake peace to his soul he was forgotten he is not going to understand<end>
<start>perso i think not a year he says it in a way as if not long ago if his was years i think valor would have sent nephis before so that if song offered him an offer that he could reflect on theirs before accepting that of song<end>
<start>the return omg<end>
<start>abuse i would say<end>
<start>i see them as two types that look alike in reality<end>
<start>nan i speak in screen mdrr<end>
<start>false<end>
<start>thank you for the chap gray<end>
<start>that is why the government did not seem to know about the sovereigns i think and absolutely no one knows where he is<end>
<start>you are only in<end>
<start>and as sunny has overcome superior creatures by being master and now he can even afford to let his avatars take care of superior creatures relatively quietly<end>
<start>what do i say<end>
<start>g is sadistic i am a matrix waiting for me at a half tinted end and never have a good xd denouement<end>
<start>chuck norris is weaver<end>
<start>shibalaugh<end>
<start>with lots of grain you sand and can make a pile of sand shibalaugh<end>
<start>elfie that tlm admires and her husband that tlm forgets<end>
<start>stv i check before<end>
<start>but it may be going alone as other cohort members do not seem to be present<end>
<start>we still do not know why the boat was the right one so it would make sense<end>
<start>by being just a saint<end>
<start>they just got into the valor citadel<end>
<start>it makes me sad in advance<end>
<start>psq the line and powers are two different things it speaks to you of the line of the shadow as it has inherited from the line of weaver<end>
<start>how he must be too embarassed<end>
<start>what do i like<end>
<start>i know that here i live gray<end>
<start>the second would be the most exciting but the first the most plausible<end>
<start>maybe i am bugging<end>
<start>next time it will appear in good lava fusion<end>
<start>you do not want to offend yourself you take people too much for idiots<end>
<start>it would be a shame that both did exactly the same thing<end>
<start>he said thank you basically coreen<end>
<start>seeing that the dananke mask also hangs so she is not supposed to forget<end>
<start>on the ground no<end>
<start>it is very low as proba but it is possible because a corrupt soul is differententente of a normal soul so the transfo can be differententente<end>
<start>in any way does not work domains will not be explained immediately<end>
<start>he is not the god of death dcp<end>
<start>a thought of the parisians and the inhabitants of the frankish count who have this break pdt their vacation jen is part of<end>
<start>you want to talk about the child-master and ruler attributes of shadows i imagine<end>
<start>jpense that he just lost his submissiveness to the sortlege and the schemes of the sortlege<end>
<start>you think he is going to roll out without a nightmare<end>
<start>and in general evil but only if she wants it<end>
<start>the people we have had to see<end>
<start>yes and i think that his necessary for him in his highest rank<end>
<start>i am in<end>
<start>i pref wide the exit moment i wanted to discover how the world plunges into the realm of dreams<end>
<start>or receive ect memories<end>
<start>maybe it is got to break it down<end>
<start>good luck chaki<end>
<start>there is also the weaver mask<end>
<start>not stupid<end>
<start>rather thanks to weaver<end>
<start>psq is a thief<end>
<start>enjoy this suffering<end>
<start>we know by hop that daemons are the fault of the gods<end>
<start>that would be highly probable<end>
<start>at last the eye<end>
<start>it is still a god<end>
<start>professor obel gives this number<end>
<start>even though he had months and months to prepare<end>
<start>after i find that end v is the best time of work to take a break i do not regret my choice and i would recommend it almost<end>
<start>he put me in shit<end>
<start>other works there is chapter of delay so it is understandable<end>
<start>who can destroy fate<end>
<start>an impure beast that is zero in fact<end>
<start>it makes me weird to tell me that we get to the chapter in a short time<end>
<start>yes it was true that he had killed holy and the others<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewpsyduck-flex-buff-tough-fight-gif-<end>
<start>your saint is not the pair of bezels with the best glass<end>
<start>asterion is still after the war<end>
<start>i also think<end>
<start>yeah but he could not leave town and multiply while he is got millions of potential bodies<end>
<start>you are doing well<end>
<start>chapters on the other hand amazing i love when sunny tease kai<end>
<start>maybe i scratch my veins while waiting to see the gray message saying this chapter marks the end of the volume<end>
<start>so i am going to sunny is sacred when returning to the tomb<end>
<start>tonight i should be<end>
<start>what happiness this bow<end>
<start>sunny wins against nephis now or not<end>
<start>we will live the death of the father of nephis in the nightmare<end>
<start>i have understood more or less<end>
<start>psq j believe someone who knows died in<end>
<start>and like his class c the sunny nuclei<end>
<start>it is useful to create an anchor<end>
<start>she is good at it<end>
<start>in the last chaps<end>
<start>no the sortlege is just an intermediate between all that just sunny is outside the tapestry of destiny<end>
<start>naaaaaaaaaaaaan<end>
<start>you know it is not funny<end>
<start>y physical improvement the development of capacities before the possibility of having new attributes is already sufficient<end>
<start>so why would not she<end>
<start>wait till you see that it is worth because unlike the fielon it must be incredible<end>
<start>can only change details can be an inspiration<end>
<start>because cassia is afraid of the consequences of trying to change destiny she does not share her knowledge as her<end>
<start>why every time i take it back it has to cut at the best time huh hutaodead<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewprabhas-yes-agreed-agree-saaho-gif-<end>
<start>she is a little in the middle of it<end>
<start>she knew very well what he was going to do<end>
<start>i just hope i love the elispe but the author is not starting to make nephis come out with the first come because she forgets the existence of nephis<end>
<start>he said it was the sortlege that created them but after sunny can still interact with if the sortlege uses concepts like anchoring for the citadel<end>
<start>it must be like sunny<end>
<start>psq the mad prince technically has one more clone<end>
<start>if she is fun she also confronts her without her appearance<end>
<start>frankly respect<end>
<start>if he ever made revolutions when the wounds existed it is all<end>
<start>hi everyone i have stopped at the end of the volume of the blow it is been chapters since how heavy theft is<end>
<start>i do not get too wet by validing her shibalaugh<end>
<start>i think it is going to be a break<end>
<start>no need i am not debile<end>
<start>in tt case<end>
<start>the chapter marked you<end>
<start>ah bah the jsis petering my skull with all the revelations<end>
<start>there is a guy who is got spoil going<end>
<start>jet was half of sunny<end>
<start>if a clone is capable of this<end>
<start>for you see it not necessarily seen that gray is regular on the release of the chapters but me from my side who took an abo on webnovel and read the chapters in advance his fact month that g has more and more decal the release of his chapters he says that he wants to make more consistent chapters but must not wonder that rated the guy tired also<end>
<start>why not<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewboo-gif-<end>
<start>that is right<end>
<start>it is like he is all crazy<end>
<start>for me she is infected by the exit masi awakens without the seed is retained by the power of the song precisely she is not like sunny so it seems possible that after her eiveil she has memories ect<end>
<start>it is the only one known to have a sea of dark love<end>
<start>i am almost there<end>
<start>if a normal person kills a nightmare creation does he receives a fragment like an awakened person<end>
<start>i can finally show it<end>
<start>but if sunny passes supreme and the theory that they can invoke his shadows from his sea of love to his domain is true<end>
<start>all right he will not survive<end>
<start>brooo you go back to read pepewow<end>
<start>ptet has the end and again<end>
<start>said<end>
<start>if they have access to it<end>
<start>the others we do not know either<end>
<start>but if not yes you did<end>
<start>ah excuse me i did not understand in feeling<end>
<start>yeah it is very likely<end>
<start>well seen captain obvious<end>
<start>yeah that is it<end>
<start>good after the superior fleaux is the breakfast of sunny<end>
<start>in real life the third nightmare he was not incredible he was well<end>
<start>but my time has come i have to take back for this<end>
<start>the shadow bed i think he can<end>
<start>yeah i know i am just talking about the interest it might have<end>
<start>even worse he can miss and being abandoned would be horrible<end>
<start>i have a little trouble understanding the principles related to this but maybe we will have another explanation later to explain when we will have to explain the situation to the team again<end>
<start>nan but you want to look like the people you admire<end>
<start>put it on to remove it just after i do not see the interest<end>
<start>yes week or jsp g released on and on in mm time<end>
<start>hutaostare<end>
<start>that is all<end>
<start>and therefore weaver and made from sons of destiny<end>
<start>nether is not really associated with destiny<end>
<start>like one said we are not sure the daeron estate is tied to water<end>
<start>it must be a minimum bond to appearance i think<end>
<start>not the sortlege that makes people not remember sunny<end>
<start>i have been printing this month<end>
<start>yeah it is a possibility<end>
<start>i just thought of something<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewit-was-a-damn-good-time-jon-pardi-cmt-awards-cmt-awesome-gif-<end>
<start>life i am too stupid<end>
<start>it will not be over<end>
<start>she says it when he has not shown up yet i think and even if she does not see it she must understand that there is something when nephis talks to her<end>
<start>especially that to get home if they go through the classic way there are all the monsters on the walls etc<end>
<start>she thinks it is a mitto<end>
<start>he needs at least one body i think<end>
<start>even if it looks regularly updated<end>
<start>then we did not get what the bird did to his soul yet and what the sons he ripped out were<end>
<start>the kingdom of shadow must exist it was the god of shadow before creating death<end>
<start>they cannot win a war<end>
<start>this is a possibility not to exclude the knife was still there so it can be alive<end>
<start>wtf is a day and yet it does not tell me that<end>
<start>you will read daily or let chapters accumulate<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewside-eye-dog-suspicious-look-suspicious-doubt-dog-doubt-gif-<end>
<start>author's will may be<end>
<start>it will be a new person they know of<end>
<start>i do not see him<end>
<start>it is said that the saints were afraid of jet at some point they were afraid that she would become holy or they were already afraid of her as master<end>
<start>nothing<end>
<start>att att att<end>
<start>a dormant titan would even have good physics<end>
<start>bastard laughs nan in real life the poor but ping not rodr on it is not yet i told him not to stop until he read this chap if he can<end>
<start>sunny's author name is nobody<end>
<start>ceasing the mirror of truth c jcrois<end>
<start>psq if song and anvil have divine aspects jai a hard time seeing sunny and others come out alive from the war<end>
<start>and groove met the whole cohort at sunny they will forget it or not i am having a little trouble<end>
<start>ready to bet that the creation of the last chapter is close to it<end>
<start>i think the weird thing is that she could not see in advance what is going to happen in the well if fate is broken<end>
<start>the next chaps will be crazy<end>
<start>at the bottom of the hole yes<end>
<start>he is just with nephis<end>
<start>seen the speed at which he rearranges his cores<end>
<start>right now i am less broken than usual<end>
<start>sunny did not have a light authority on the shadows<end>
<start>if tabuse they just do not have the descriptions and a less detailed story<end>
<start>but we will find out if any sunny goes vrm in the hollow mountains i think<end>
<start>i am going to die my eyes<end>
<start>but it happens it is life<end>
<start>thin it will be m then<end>
<start>once upon the end of the tomb<end>
<start>thank you gray<end>
<start>jet only woman who does not handle sunny and does not have a kid<end>
<start>as it says it is better to remain in ignorance of certain things<end>
<start>if ever a possessor of divine attribute a nuclei and for example does the loss of a kernel turn into or into<end>
<start>nan i believe he took the real name that linked him to fate spell<end>
<start>and then just having a hostage is pretty much better than anything that could involve killing master sunless shibalaugh<end>
<start>after it is a crazy job to translate and transcribe everything<end>
<start>you have to trust g sah<end>
<start>it is one of the facets of his character but to say that it is completely egoistic would be false also<end>
<start>tqt laughs<end>
<start>aie aie aie les nouvelles memoires derain<end>
<start>but really like all<end>
<start>it depends on the kind of intelligence in real life<end>
<start>i know i know<end>
<start>i just read<end>
<start>i am pretty sure it is going to have a rain-like look and it is got it raining so much<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfabien-yes-not-mal-gif-<end>
<start>it is not impossible since nether was aware of the weaver line<end>
<start>o but thanks to its appearance<end>
<start>there was no real reward at the end of a nightmare if<end>
<start>it is going to happen when even shibalaugh he is probably going to give him a wake-up armor so people do not even wonder if it is too funny to see the groove reaction if he does that shibalaugh<end>
<start>he is not the same type of happiness<end>
<start>you are hot<end>
<start>ora then the chap i do not know at all but it is when they are on the turtle at the beginning of the encounter<end>
<start>good evening i am desperably looking for an answer i just saw that the worldnovel site had a discord server so i went straight to the link<end>
<start>yes but i am sure his one who is in the nether den at the most difficult time to reach<end>
<start>on the other hand i would see him more through a nightmare than through a natural eye i am not even sure he is as aware as possible<end>
<start>it ruines women's people so much this kind of bullshit<end>
<start>i allow myself to correct<end>
<start>he loses his cores<end>
<start>we do not want you<end>
<start>if not your death overall<end>
<start>so in a short time there is at least level door that arrives according to your theory<end>
<start>they then<end>
<start>a drill in what<end>
<start>yeah it is got to be some sort of control over the emergency bodies<end>
<start>but you must be right about the information you have got<end>
<start>kai what is he style<end>
<start>hahahahah on the other hand just week i did not expect that<end>
<start>wesshhhhhhh<end>
<start>mort is the prince of what already<end>
<start>i do not think the goal is ever to be<end>
<start>not me oripawnkill<end>
<start>of the chapters<end>
<start>she is running<end>
<start>slt the bearer of divine aspect i have observed you<end>
<start>but dcp for you looks plausible<end>
<start>it depends on works<end>
<start>there it is<end>
<start>it is not very logical after for a human mind that two are still at the same time and especially that for arain his master is a supreme or even a sacred while the sdo is a saint<end>
<start>we agree pipo imp chan is superior<end>
<start>even though it might be his destiny to go and it does not change anything<end>
<start>so we are going to be able to enjoy the downfall defie for another chapter<end>
<start>gray puts an emiliahappy under all thank you messages<end>
<start>i am going achbye<end>
<start>they are copies of him<end>
<start>i will be the narrator you will be cassie shibalaugh<end>
<start>i do not remember anything you can write the scene a little bit<end>
<start>he is the only one i would ever see being really powerful<end>
<start>you are so not ready to laugh<end>
<start>on one side they will have the chance to have the full story of another they will not have the pleasure to discover days after days not false ahah<end>
<start>so i immediately arrest you the person of the house of the night that sunny meets in antarctica in the ships more precisely it is naeve sean never appeared in the work<end>
<start>it must be stronger<end>
<start>because with the memory of sunny i was afraid that all that was going on would pass through the window<end>
<start>basically sunny was fighting the bite creation that could copy people<end>
<start>so that sunny recovers her destiny and her identity just get her real name back so he just has to kill the bird that is a cursed terror he will do it when he enters the pyramid and he will meet his him from the pass like that loop will be looped and he will be able to install his presence in the nightmare<end>
<start>before bcp wrote some stuff some at each chapter then stuffed new person but since chapter about more person<end>
<start>may be part of his god's authority but his seems plausible to me<end>
<start>who does not have a brandon spoil<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfrog-wait-what-kermit-huh-wat-gif-<end>
<start>and above all the line would come out of it if it possessed it<end>
<start>we know stuff about her power<end>
<start>transcenddate same rank same heritage<end>
<start>when he cooks like that<end>
<start>and i was half a spoil on the last ones with the break thing<end>
<start>and the best way she found was to give the real name of sunny to stop the fight<end>
<start>but the tomb is too weird<end>
<start>i think about it but if it is the combo of ariel a daemon carcase of divine titan at the end of times all this all that allows him to get out of the control of fate mordret would not have used a witchcraft of daemon at any chance hop or nether in the tower of ebene we had seen that red parcelee had the ability to cut sunny from the exitlege the runes that he would have serious on his core make me think of an application detournee if there were material on the spot may be that asterion suggested to him he seems to know about this gere of tricks and bitet could not have learned it alone<end>
<start>it takes the physics of the universe squarely it is schwarzenneger<end>
<start>we did not see anything<end>
<start>i think they are too small<end>
<start>weaver carrier mask so much<end>
<start>the horse he breathes and everything<end>
<start>tyrant nan<end>
<start>i would like to hammer it all<end>
<start>i do them<end>
<start>and especially the end of the shore<end>
<start>he makes a love triangle with him even but the triangle has an angle to<end>
<start>end part i am coming<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewspace-dance-nasa-artemis-dance-floss-gif-<end>
<start>you thought snake was a jbl<end>
<start>but fucking yes<end>
<start>i say as long as dumpling stays alive it is okay<end>
<start>but in real life i would have liked him to use the eclats of the winter beast for an impressive thing because it was a creature that marked him and just skip his death it is a little sad especially for the soldiers she killed<end>
<start>it is limit jla see already with wings<end>
<start>years<end>
<start>sunny is free everyone out quiet<end>
<start>or talk about their meeting in the city of siege or anvil fought the superior titan<end>
<start>kai is the only one with sunny to have its evolute look<end>
<start>she could not have done better to make herself forgive than giving back the choice to sunny<end>
<start>intelligence does not do everything<end>
<start>note x<end>
<start>for me weaver saw the slowness of the destiny of origin at the end and has been trying since he was in the vacuum to create something capable of changing that destiny which would end up destroying the whole world by the forgotten god and he would therefore have influence and help cassie in order to bring out sunny from the tapestry of destiny<end>
<start>if maybe<end>
<start>i think the opposite is true<end>
<start>imagining biter laughs<end>
<start>if neph can have it everyone can<end>
<start>yeah for now but if g comes back on fights not against hordes but rather only great enemy would be better for me<end>
<start>what is his transfo<end>
<start>i have got a hard bite<end>
<start>i did not even think about it<end>
<start>ba we saw the sunny of the future suverrain in the pyramid nan<end>
<start>oh no effort shibalaugh<end>
<start>inverse default is often worse than default<end>
<start>but you really did not understand<end>
<start>sadly for you dear bono<end>
<start>they do what they want<end>
<start>it was not a spear<end>
<start>she is crazy<end>
<start>ba in the movie sunny it is a pnj that serves nothing apart from the comic phrases on nephis that makes you sick main quote of sunny and ba mtn it is in correlation with reality or sunny was afface of destiny and did nothing in the sense or mtn nephis thinks vrm did everything alone<end>
<start>i went to check to be on the sortlege chosen always his words with care it is sunny who says it when he receives the lantern in his abilities as in his attributes he never uses the word authority to describe the sunny capa<end>
<start>ptdr<end>
<start>the gap has each time is bcp too powerful a sleeping gap wakes up it goes that fact but the holy master gap is way too energized they beat the wolf only because they are divine rank and the bird has escaped to weaver a demon who has the same level as a god<end>
<start>in one way or another<end>
<start>whispering blade is the tone<end>
<start>pay attention<end>
<start>and sending my answer i remembered something<end>
<start>yeah mb<end>
<start>and she is not going to hatch until she is in the singing field<end>
<start>maybe it is one of the biting bodies that is why she looks lifeless<end>
<start>sunny's half crazy alone halala<end>
<start>on the other hand they have at least the description of the memory not<end>
<start>and we know almost nothing about their capacity<end>
<start>plus i did not see it is a giga csc my rookie<end>
<start>a lot less badass<end>
<start>go your most ka chapter of the end<end>
<start>he wanted to talk about bones and blood changing from sunny jpense<end>
<start>i do not see the sovereigns like that<end>
<start>gooper is not up to date on fr<end>
<start>if it happens he has a mega reserve<end>
<start>we are talking about weaving fate baby<end>
<start>the<end>
<start>most stuff exists without the sortlege it just makes everything a lot easier<end>
<start>i was not talking about staying in that corner not necessarily on sunny<end>
<start>man i cannot take it anymore<end>
<start>but when you say volume you talk about the shore forgets whole or just the volume<end>
<start>nothing they tried to shoot me but i am alive noproblemcrying<end>
<start>that is if he keeps the shadow bond<end>
<start>it is also possible in real life<end>
<start>the missile he is left at the end of the shibalaugh<end>
<start>but between kai and jet if they have to choose they will not hesite<end>
<start>a crossword it passes the weapon to the left<end>
<start>there was a paper publication start of the work<end>
<start>i do not know what mongrel has become if the sortlege has made him look like a legend like the devil of the antarctic and if he has made people forget him little by little but if people remember mongrel even thinking that he is a legend and that they are making a rapprochement with the lord of shadows it may be re-establishing a first attachment to the destiny that sunny has lost and pushing when even a little far away it may be that which allowed us to remember a minimum<end>
<start>it would be better if qqun could impal him<end>
<start>i almost asked a few more times mdr<end>
<start>dude for the gray chaps<end>
<start>in real life she goes out with sunny for shape but in fact she is in relation to the lord of shabalaugh shadows<end>
<start>clones which he uses at the same time as if he does<end>
<start>it would not be bad but unlikely<end>
<start>do my bad<end>
<start>in real life of the shot yes nightmare it is most likely<end>
<start>nan but if she sees a big emptiness she does not know that it is him<end>
<start>imagining sunny dating morgana like that when he sees modret he says look at her i have got your syou are<end>
<start>i know what you mean<end>
<start>yeah even if without her real name that served her anchor it will be more complicated<end>
<start>or maybe a very short death<end>
<start>i want to hit you<end>
<start>vrm the scene of neph that weeps a cable and the keeper of the fire who look that pepite<end>
<start>and kai especially because he really is the guy who sacrificed himself<end>
<start>which would not be for me but good<end>
<start>it would be a wonderful entry but far too strong for my taste unless he has to face the big clans but it even seems too strong<end>
<start>what is the point of that he is already got his fans for that shibalaugh<end>
<start>thank you ie g catscreen<end>
<start>okkkkkkkkkk<end>
<start>it is not so different that it shibalaugh<end>
<start>and genre for the future and tt fight they will lead the shadow bond with nephis is just too practical<end>
<start>this is a warning will not look at the titles of the last chapter otherwise you risk a big major spoil<end>
<start>after maybe it is better to have sunny increased twice as sunny increases a or sunny<end>
<start>on the death of kai tsais the guy who does not want to leave his theory<end>
<start>especially asterion<end>
<start>if but he can make the armor spawn if he wants<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewph-ph-sonic-riders-gif-<end>
<start>same way it is him lanta final larc<end>
<start>because she was introduced mysterious and everything but she served not much compared to others at the moment<end>
<start>we have already had the debate millions of times i have given up the anti-castia<end>
<start>here i leave that tell me what you think nephis<end>
<start>bah nan ceased the normality back there tsais lenglish<end>
<start>aevildgenk<end>
<start>like he already has his clones<end>
<start>even damned it is hot in real life<end>
<start>but especially with the last chapters i wanted to know everything in real time<end>
<start>no information yet<end>
<start>then i continued<end>
<start>why not<end>
<start>shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>can be infected with universes and not planets<end>
<start>the beginning<end>
<start>and to enter into a nightmare since the kingdom of dreams it is enough to leave the zone of influence of a sovereign<end>
<start>yep bah it is of the work accomplished<end>
<start>nope i changed recently it became the sin of comfort<end>
<start>and especially we are talking about a guy who comes back from the shore forgets and who is part of the changing star cohort<end>
<start>as a supreme<end>
<start>i am the only stress i do not want to get back to their relationship after i have had trouble with you<end>
<start>thanks batou<end>
<start>it is for that sunny asked a groove to close your eyes<end>
<start>maybe not up to date the wiki<end>
<start>i think it stays when even a good time before the end of the volume<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>sunny would have watched the super nova<end>
<start>yes if we can call his a beta on the day or he can convert the monsters kill into memory already all ready as the original release lege we can say that he has succeeded<end>
<start>what is going on<end>
<start>around jdirai like this<end>
<start>they will blame him<end>
<start>it comes from the fact that nephis was not corrupt unlike the others so the whole cohort probably kills action initiated by the crazy prince to free himself<end>
<start>that must be it<end>
<start>we have seen one since the beginning<end>
<start>one<end>
<start>you are a day yoch<end>
<start>it is not directly connecting to sunny he probably verifies all the users of holy shadow and he does not have one and pouf a saint come from nowhere disembarking it is a coincidence<end>
<start>i am really going to ban def people who spoil<end>
<start>as sunny says the kai truth should be able to aquiesce about everything<end>
<start>overall<end>
<start>that was the crown<end>
<start>yeah but she will complete their team if she gets archers' capabilities and it will give another reason a sunny to hate even more<end>
<start>i even said he was talking about it at some point<end>
<start>strongly the next major arc<end>
<start>i think i had a taste of reading a treat huh<end>
<start>professional word game creator<end>
<start>tkt not all trades here outstanding years of imprisonment and fine<end>
<start>sunny and neph jles considered immortal<end>
<start>every body she owns will hear the slap<end>
<start>it was predictable but i have been saying it so since the beginning it is plaiz<end>
<start>without lying when the decal story on groove i am less interested<end>
<start>gender with the observatory<end>
<start>i read the english chapters in advance and i also read in french when they come out<end>
<start>dsl<end>
<start>tears that go up<end>
<start>yeah but as it was said jet is alive only because of her default she is probably going to die if he is in reverse<end>
<start>sunny chose himself<end>
<start>it is the echo<end>
<start>ah so maybe<end>
<start>no ship on groove seen degeneres on the serv g i want to avoid at all costs ca<end>
<start>or it has a connection to nothing<end>
<start>she can easily ez dcp<end>
<start>they can read but not like sunny i think<end>
<start>but on the other hand is what the gods c vrmt just of the divine titan or the divine beasts<end>
<start>since he cannot pass the guard<end>
<start>but i think so too<end>
<start>i cannot believe it is coming out of the head of one human being<end>
<start>she actually seems a little weak for a divine-looking detentress she gets beaten by the brother of anvil who misgresses that he remains a saint without divine aspect<end>
<start>o sunny says one of the only things that differentiates them is their birthplace<end>
<start>c sunny so he will not have a weird thought but his rest bizzare<end>
<start>so the gods would be like titans if they had hearts<end>
<start>yes i know the passages like this must be a hell to translate as best as possible<end>
<start>so in a sense if<end>
<start>after that information that cassie had already<end>
<start>i already said it<end>
<start>jiras check his tomorrow brc chief<end>
<start>and not to his proxism<end>
<start>who closes his eye to the moon<end>
<start>yeah right<end>
<start>the kingdom of dreams is not just corruption of the god of dreams<end>
<start>me last night<end>
<start>i have doubts about when its before the end of the french chaps i do not mean stuff not released en fr<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthe-simpsons-homer-simpson-good-bye-no-gif-<end>
<start>especially as all the divination abilities work more<end>
<start>me more mtn since i have the personal agreement you are the only one laughing<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>we all blew up tkt<end>
<start>ohh sadness<end>
<start>and nether destinee<end>
<start>she did not forget weaver's mask she forgot weave's mask when he was wearing by sunny<end>
<start>the er academie before the nd nightmare after and now<end>
<start>but deep down what madness is<end>
<start>you are lucky too cbbleh<end>
<start>it is the chapters paying gray exits the chapters en fr at the same time as the free english chapters<end>
<start>on the raft<end>
<start>other than ri and lotm<end>
<start>that is when even ten thousand corrupt beasts<end>
<start>i am asking if you are going to go above the rank of ascendant<end>
<start>maybe he does it to the skin walker to watch it<end>
<start>goddamn it you know the chap by heart mdrr<end>
<start>it is true xd<end>
<start>yes that is clear<end>
<start>he is back he is been seeing her making her nightmare for months<end>
<start>i am staying on the theory that i had done a while ago<end>
<start>we will see but in the idea i cannot see him directly but the more master we will know soon enough<end>
<start>it was a joke<end>
<start>but it is as we explained it<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewflattered-oh-you-fresh-prince-gif-<end>
<start>so i did not read after that so we did not see the transfos of the other menvt of the cohort<end>
<start>crazy i thought he was going to be able to copy the transfos of others but he can already do it i am having trouble imagining what else his can be<end>
<start>personal i voted - cassia ere - saint - prince mad i avoided adding sunny expres<end>
<start>emiliahappy<end>
<start>what makes you say that<end>
<start>ptn naaann sunny pk ta all sway mtn still a little more and we would have had a kiss<end>
<start>as they return to the tomb<end>
<start>there is no well of wishes ptdrrrr<end>
<start>nephis this doubt of something<end>
<start>no but jpars from the principle that as it is fragments of a god they can not be as strong in pure power as real gods<end>
<start>towards the end<end>
<start>especially out of fear<end>
<start>but now there was a movie with sunny and the cohort<end>
<start>me when i reincarnate as a gladiator of the shadow in a magical world<end>
<start>you are going vrm stack for months or what for the valve<end>
<start>ah bah dsl<end>
<start>but he is not dead it is on me it is great priest of the sort<end>
<start>when he passes titan<end>
<start>it is just when you get out of the dream realm<end>
<start>i thought you would read with a third he or a piece of shit like that<end>
<start>it is not bad<end>
<start>this is a possibility but in the cases he still had the crown because he succeeded in peeger tt the world has twilight<end>
<start>a see if there is a way to link the fragment with the citadel in this case it should be possible<end>
<start>for this world i believe it yeah<end>
<start>as<end>
<start>vsy tell us<end>
<start>nan it was not attached in it was in the reflection of a mirror the chains is for something else<end>
<start>psq with shadows he does what he wants<end>
<start>all because he is spoiling on tiktok laughs<end>
<start>and there is only one<end>
<start>the end of the chapter makes it seem that song can control the worms and that would be why she is called the queen of moese worms nan not average<end>
<start>yup is with the dance of shadow and the ascension of sunny<end>
<start>because he received it before his separation with neph that is to say before he received the endless spring by cassia<end>
<start>so i made the decision of re-stack on the volume<end>
<start>good thing it is not a crazy thing<end>
<start>bah do me i tell myself i reserve total rereading for when work is on the end<end>
<start>there is such a fan base of noctis i am surprised<end>
<start>i do not see the interest<end>
<start>i am up to date<end>
<start>big volume he makes chap after the volume his chaps after his normal if his most slice of life he emerges from the same nightmare that was of action i find it necessary when even a minimum doser action after himself<end>
<start>because it is not the same huh<end>
<start>like i said i think he is going to learn how to create an individual release<end>
<start>we are half here and you want to wait until it is almost over<end>
<start>while he<end>
<start>and in view of its future domain jthinks that the current shadows of sunny will just become the generals of the gun of sunny shadows<end>
<start>that we think it may already be shibalaugh<end>
<start>grv<end>
<start>thank you pepethankful<end>
<start>he is already seen too much stuff so it does not change anything that he is going to mtn or after the war<end>
<start>whether it is pages or it is the same<end>
<start>normally they are more bound if sunny has succeeded are beaten<end>
<start>few people can know about this<end>
<start>but i am not saying<end>
<start>and besides it is fluo<end>
<start>after sunny did not stay with her during the period or the lord of shadows saved the sleepers so she could very well imagine that he was going back to goodgrave<end>
<start>so it is confirmed that daemons have a sex<end>
<start>i think we all suffer a bit of a sunnyneph bias<end>
<start>but what a demon this snow<end>
<start>okkkk i literally did not do anything wrong but go talk is really called spoilers shadow flame there was not being violent like this is a madness of being sour as you are i really did no rule of the serv i just ask questions thanking gray every time but vasi enerve you even more reading se message<end>
<start>all deteres have their own hair<end>
<start>well i am up to date<end>
<start>genus seishan morgan etc<end>
<start>i am going to let go at least a few hundred chaps<end>
<start>yeah he is been over since<end>
<start>it makes sense but g is going through a phase or he is going out his chapters at more than h of the time i understand gray who has the flemmer to wait for his kind<end>
<start>i think it does not matter to them<end>
<start>at least he has to pass the same<end>
<start>he is already fighting with himself<end>
<start>yeah but she got what she wanted<end>
<start>thanks to the description of the memory that sunny had you will see in not long you will have a better explanation<end>
<start>i cannot imagine<end>
<start>thanks for the chapq<end>
<start>for example<end>
<start>sunny and neph are going to have another rdv<end>
<start>not possible because she will not have help of the sortlege little theory she will have no default<end>
<start>but i agree with you for asterion<end>
<start>oops<end>
<start>i put a wind on you<end>
<start>heritages of jet appearance and the fact that it is practically immortal and all one shot<end>
<start>remember that the future is changed by every little thing done or said and prevent sunny could have prevented it from reaching its goal all the more since sunny would have been merciless that suddenly it does that butterfly effect and all the tralala and as irritated the said cassie was witness to many different things and futures so she probably took the best to avoid any indesirable consequences<end>
<start>all the reflection on the art of combat<end>
<start>i feel a sacred asterion<end>
<start>it happens to be kai is dead<end>
<start>like what weaver covid<end>
<start>yeah the arrow that can cross everything if there is no armor<end>
<start>soon you join us<end>
<start>that is overrated social life in any way<end>
<start>even he takes it like a joke<end>
<start>i think he is trying to make a good deal for himself<end>
<start>it is more than she does not have to get some early ones<end>
<start>yes really x<end>
<start>a new<end>
<start>wait a long time to read the chaps but<end>
<start>bah non sunny future was still in the estuary<end>
<start>kai my persono pref<end>
<start>boiled the null<end>
<start>after yards is not the main detail that makes me know the end<end>
<start>after how it works the domain would happen to be present in the real world<end>
<start>since we are that a week after the battle all the great clans must lack saints<end>
<start>nan when not even<end>
<start>and really i do not know what to think of sunny and modret the thing is that their characters are getting so busted up that they can be best friends but they hate each other<end>
<start>not with the demonstration but it changes whatever it is<end>
<start>but he can do crazy stuff<end>
<start>to see what the loss of the exit leg really means<end>
<start>after that my opinion and i am not up to date yet catscream<end>
<start>well he is got to go back to the tomb<end>
<start>it is no use going anywhere else<end>
<start>it would be even more beautiful<end>
<start>but i am thinking sunny stops being a slave and he is called how the newer is<end>
<start>it seems to me what the death of her mother does not call what death<end>
<start>thanks nephis for the sabre classes but<end>
<start>dcp month ago<end>
<start>shame but a big thank you to him there are a lot of assholes who could have threatened us<end>
<start>days<end>
<start>lifting<end>
<start>more than you have to wait<end>
<start>before me catscream<end>
<start>because it is rare that a saint does not have one<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewlepa-brena-turbofolk-army-gif-<end>
<start>it would have been possible without the sound of a smile if g had put it down for a good reason<end>
<start>it is true that sunny is like holy in<end>
<start>miiiissskiiiiineneeeeeeee<end>
<start>good luck soldier<end>
<start>personal i think his will is going through a recovery of real name dcp<end>
<start>jsp what the sunny and groin darons gave them when he was a kid but he had to be strong sah<end>
<start>moreover cassia explains where it comes the motivation to want to change destiny<end>
<start>you tell me that but in real life if a little bit<end>
<start>and i did not say it but there is also a respect between them<end>
<start>it is crazy to say that<end>
<start>before he was the champion normally he is the king may be<end>
<start>after that i would not have been surprised that in the scenario of g cassia was already outside of destiny but theorie very blond '<end>
<start>ah ok in this sense<end>
<start>well it is not the time he opens his eye<end>
<start>mirror maze<end>
<start>it is really crazy the lore ss<end>
<start>we do not know for born<end>
<start>we may have a lot of information about jespere lines in the next volumes especially with the rise of nephis and sunny as sovereign who should not too soon<end>
<start>you think i will resume now or i will let the chapters stack again<end>
<start>who tells him he cannot be stuffed<end>
<start>that is what i thought<end>
<start>i think ya live and swear fidelite<end>
<start>in their field yes it is no use fighting them but outside it is largely feasible for nephis if it becomes supreme<end>
<start>i am my fav<end>
<start>the more doorway there is<end>
<start>o not false<end>
<start>we just know that ananke's mother was a very powerful pretress<end>
<start>of course it is very pleasant we are not going to lie but this feeling of being dazzling all day and night when there is a sunphis paske impossible to stop when there is a ca mdr it really is something<end>
<start>yeah no<end>
<start>the second cauchmar my former volum pref even if i have ever had vrm<end>
<start>and save<end>
<start>the only sovereign who does not need soldiers<end>
<start>if she does not laugh<end>
<start>this is really the high level ss nempeche<end>
<start>okay i did not know<end>
<start>they just miss a cocktail and it would be perfect entertainment guaranteed<end>
<start>plentiful anvil<end>
<start>come back to the valor clan not on after that depends you are to what chapter<end>
<start>even he sometimes gives information to questions and mentions it a little later in history<end>
<start>not basically the crazy prince is sunny who went crazy because of the truth so the crazy prince by starting a revolution died so he made sure that sunny arrived at the estuary with nephis and others alive and to return to life it had to be that sunny was corrupt<end>
<start>but after<end>
<start>and then you feel when even the loss of the sunny memories said it was too dependent on them before and that is why he applied himself to develop his transcendent art<end>
<start>speaking of line i just remembered a little detail that was short but mtn that i think serious important<end>
<start>i do not know the end of the work<end>
<start>but first deg<end>
<start>so to the end god of shadow unlikely<end>
<start>i just do not want to spoil the content that has not come out yet<end>
<start>i do not see him pulling the link<end>
<start>to weave he could learn the style of the sage<end>
<start>if it is swallowed we should not see it in the real world<end>
<start>you heard him or his<end>
<start>peoplehinganyupanik<end>
<start>i am too hating the threat he will become<end>
<start>sunny who proposes an appointment to nephis and who is shocking what accepts shibalaugh shibalaugh in fashion he expected a big no in his mouth mdr<end>
<start>cv say what mongrel<end>
<start>that is stupid<end>
<start>nan but please qqun can tell him that there is no debate<end>
<start>and if sunny confesses to nephis that he makes night appointments with cassia we can be sure that cassie will be the first member of the cohort to die shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>who is he in reality he is a furry fan this son of a bitch<end>
<start>sunny in real life he just got an echo to turn him into a shadow and make him eat full of memory to finally kill him and pass titan nan<end>
<start>heartache heartache<end>
<start>there would be less conflict in the worlds<end>
<start>there will be some on the battlefields in the shade of a groove and with the feet in an eventtail resting at a bastion<end>
<start>i prefer effie but it is my tastes but i love it very much<end>
<start>maybe we will get a recite of this end of nightmare by nephis she even later when she tells it to sunny<end>
<start>it was like that the first time too<end>
<start>i am not sure it was said<end>
<start>she forgot everything she is done for her she just found her best friend that everyone forgets and who is been alone for years<end>
<start>oh bad luck<end>
<start>also i had not read the chaps yesterday so the last of the chap c effie of romance i confess i kiffe<end>
<start>then he can come back when she is right in there<end>
<start>no i know i want to talk about the first sunny nightmare that came out<end>
<start>but outside the estuary they could not have crossed<end>
<start>authority on interesting death<end>
<start>as there is again snake the author probably do a ride on on his new abilities and why not with the dance of the shadow<end>
<start>yeah but the author insists on the fact that being more numerous than being alone but stronger<end>
<start>he is become so strong snake<end>
<start>where i am with the islands is the kingdom of dreams<end>
<start>g cook too well<end>
<start>but the future is also stronger<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewspider-man-we-one-gif-<end>
<start>talking about the connection with nephis can only convince him that their relationship would be better without and that he has to go<end>
<start>like the merchants to get their supplies they have to get out<end>
<start>i did not see that said or that asterio is in space<end>
<start>a domain of the shadow of the shadows that heal<end>
<start>and that the six wounds that would correspond to each of the cohort except nephis will be their future versions after having finished the nightmare return to the ivory tower to prepare a go again in the tomb of ariel but in their present this time<end>
<start>for me in max chaps we pass on pov shadow with the echoes of the argument through a pov neph<end>
<start>that is why i was wondering why the story did not show how sunny feels about losing her friends and literally her existence<end>
<start>she did not know everything i think she planned solutions<end>
<start>strategic retreats<end>
<start>and there may be a difference between domain and authority<end>
<start>o but i believe he has described as asterion to attach to the people before or i know more what<end>
<start>a few hours from the continuation of the publication of our sovereign gray i see sunny betraying his friends and adventure alone towards the estuary<end>
<start>a link to the disappearance of lost of light avis<end>
<start>you will never shibalaugh me<end>
<start>it also allows it to have access to older shadows so more powerful as long as it has previously stored them<end>
<start>suuny can afford not to win evens but groove no<end>
<start>in his visions<end>
<start>with rodr we finally catch up<end>
<start>catscream catscream catscream<end>
<start>it must stink<end>
<start>g a cook one of those things<end>
<start>sorry ellen waiting for me<end>
<start>thank you for the explanation i understand better why there is not one yet thank you for the translation that is really hyper clean because in english i would have had trouble<end>
<start>but at any time she can be wrong<end>
<start>if he is no longer carrying the exit leg she cannot see him anymore and she may have had vision of him<end>
<start>be the shadow developed a connection with neph so possible<end>
<start>one day he will answer her she will not understand what is going on<end>
<start>and what kind of stuff about him nobody knows<end>
<start>we are talking about my ptit kai hutaoayaya<end>
<start>practice<end>
<start>because we do not know all about its power<end>
<start>i am going to say it again it is not here to say it but in httpsdiscordcomchannels or in my mp thank you for coming back<end>
<start>we do not really know what it is like to just assume<end>
<start>and the whole volume in bulk<end>
<start>in literary translation ca gives real comfort<end>
<start>detail which cannot be ignored<end>
<start>making the strong even stronger<end>
<start>but it did not happen again<end>
<start>so kai's going to think you are not lying when it is not true<end>
<start>so sunny as he has stored shadows in the lantern he is never running<end>
<start>so yeah sinister croc the saint they v with nephis<end>
<start>they are major and vaccinated<end>
<start>so i wonder if cv not just be an ocean at the storm sea<end>
<start>nodnod<end>
<start>well i had to talk a little bit about where i am because it is amazing<end>
<start>do not be too abused<end>
<start>psq it comes out every day whatever happens<end>
<start>yes it is in no nightmare just it wanders in the kingdom of dreams<end>
<start>bcp of possibilities<end>
<start>i did in weeks the tricky level i reached to pretend to work during my internship<end>
<start>really have to understand the different genre classerang but from very far away<end>
<start>but why do not you want to read the chapters every day when it comes out<end>
<start>it is not just a click for a click<end>
<start>maybe she is only got a few memories but it seems simple<end>
<start>the weaver line<end>
<start>yes tkt<end>
<start>someone knows if the volume is soon finished please<end>
<start>in the end have we not all been estuary researchers<end>
<start>to save nephis especially<end>
<start>so we can even cut it in the end of<end>
<start>or there is something i did not get<end>
<start>we know the transcendent capacity of cassia<end>
<start>there is even no debate<end>
<start>one day the gods will fall and reveal their lie to him who sleeps will wake up to eat his children oh and all that has been forgotten will be recalled and consume the world oh we will all see the nightmare of the god forget<end>
<start>then it is normal that a saint pretends to be a master<end>
<start>but takes the time to appreciate<end>
<start>but does the cassy aspect capacity not work thanks to the sortlege precisely<end>
<start>but those of the real world<end>
<start>nan sah her memory is really bad for now<end>
<start>it will be my first theory that makes sense<end>
<start>then i reread shibalaugh<end>
<start>because in the end i tell myself if it is not this soldier there may have someone with a divine aspect and the line of the demon of oblivion do not no one remembers badly that he may have had an impact in some arc without knowing it<end>
<start>since the majority of the gain of power of a sovereign has let it come from the domain<end>
<start>thank you for the chapters<end>
<start>the beautiful epoca<end>
<start>it seems to me that it is said that it appeared first on the colonists of the moon but then i tell you this from head so i can crash very heavily x<end>
<start>he cannot lie at all<end>
<start>okay that surprised me<end>
<start>if i have seen any<end>
<start>in real life that i will find it really weird though<end>
<start>and even he is got avatars all over the place so it is boring<end>
<start>you can say they are friends sure<end>
<start>here i was thinking too<end>
<start>c'est cooked<end>
<start>cassia marks are not shared between the clones of sunny as he can ask her<end>
<start>jy perso never believed but at the end threw in mode i force it may be read but no<end>
<start>so me too<end>
<start>normally nan<end>
<start>i love too much fucking bite<end>
<start>yet mongrel and sunny never were connected except by no one at all<end>
<start>the monster he is going to be and also the lord of incredible terror i find<end>
<start>jpp stop<end>
<start>yeah my perception of recent thanks<end>
<start>yeah but then he does not care<end>
<start>break his skull<end>
<start>the two sovereigns who can manipulate in one case of the epees and in the other of the bodies in their domain will freak out when they see sunny doing the same but better when it passes supreme<end>
<start>no if are domain does not need the same resource as the other<end>
<start>i think that to think it is going to be asterion that is going to steal his domain<end>
<start>it would not be useful to cause changing starliness to the heroine of humanity<end>
<start>and ya differentiating chaps between premium and free version<end>
<start>he talks about a piece of wood and we know that the chain breaker and special kind of his wood and bizzar but not enough to prevent sunny from burning it with the loneliness fisher while the dananke ketch was made to resist the river<end>
<start>a little near the world except snow and rodr jcrois<end>
<start>because we are told that the gods of the sun attacked the kingdom of dreams with a ray of flame<end>
<start>he is interested<end>
<start>i confess<end>
<start>never<end>
<start>thank you for the trades<end>
<start>ptdr i did not say that shibalaugh and actually just watch out for what you are saying for not spoil plus a big part of the discussion about things quite distant<end>
<start>you can always do both<end>
<start>we know that sunny advances more his title towards the shadows evolue master i made spoil on the title of the volume but also lord etc<end>
<start>dead<end>
<start>i am thinking about preparing for almost any kind of thing but it is true that he would need more or less preparation according to the tyrant<end>
<start>and the guys are going to be shocked in fashion they disappeared day<end>
<start>eastern antaristic<end>
<start>jpose the question in case qq would have the answer but in terms of classic novel a chapter would make how many pages about<end>
<start>you broke my delire<end>
<start>but if mordret usurp the domain danvil first<end>
<start>it will be a bit like the beginning of the jpense in full transition and after jsp it will do<end>
<start>ohyeah<end>
<start>we needed a subaru like same tbate so we had to give us this little moment of return by death x<end>
<start>you were right gg<end>
<start>yes my brooooo feyfey<end>
<start>there is going to be a little cold part and a metalic part with a moon that makes things weird<end>
<start>like this<end>
<start>something that reading chapter by day will never bring you<end>
<start>yeah that is more of an interpretation from me for the coup<end>
<start>and hop pov anvil eating a sandwich<end>
<start>i think he is not going to stop at valor but yes for now it is limit<end>
<start>so basically it has a stock of shade like that if there is sun it can use its power<end>
<start>the volume is really the thing to learn the most about the lore<end>
<start>ah yes mb it is just a news out of the hat<end>
<start>personal i did not see any after it is irritated and gray that gets it because they are up to date on the go and the more i am modo since i was so i was not taking care of that at all before so it is them that you have to ask on the spoil goes and i know that yes on the same it is sometimes that there is spoil i have already seen deletions of messages for that reason so i guess it happens when it happens<end>
<start>except that the good old lucas will have to fight against one of the strongest saints in the world ptdrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>he looks like he can do so many different things<end>
<start>yeah it is technical<end>
<start>yes the future sunny of the tomb is at least a sovereign<end>
<start>do not fear his blessings<end>
<start>go and listen to the latest griffin tyler soundtrack so that he does not savor it an artist who does a lot of music inspired by the universe of shadow slav listen lost from fate by griffin tyler on soundcloud httpsonsoundcloudcombxhyz<end>
<start>just in time as previewed shibalaugh<end>
<start>closed<end>
<start>but the same<end>
<start>especially that bitret said several times that the ladies fighting against the creations of the nightmare are horrible<end>
<start>or sunny vs nephis in the tower<end>
<start>it is sad for you<end>
<start>shibalaugh good bah mission avorte back on sunny<end>
<start>guys<end>
<start>although as holy sunny can theoretically absorb part of the natural essence in lair if it is found by being sovereign this sameliore capacity and he can continually invoke certain creation<end>
<start>after ya when even bad shit<end>
<start>i have to create a key to the estuary<end>
<start>his vote noctis sunny and cassy here<end>
<start>non-castie would not be so quiet talking anephis<end>
<start>o really like she is been lying for years and in min she says it is strange a can<end>
<start>we just know that he disappeared during the war and that the war went in balls on his return<end>
<start>and that the wish causes the death of nephis<end>
<start>mixes at dreams etc it is ohv<end>
<start>but not a titan<end>
<start>and i know i do not give a shit here i always hope for the death of cassie the rest dare go on those i let you x<end>
<start>it is the preli of the fight<end>
<start>yeah for me the different destinies that have a line that does not seem to bother<end>
<start>it is better<end>
<start>psq if you kill sunny<end>
<start>in pure singular combat as ca neph is probably the strongest given its appearance<end>
<start>i confess the norm csc even if assumed is genial<end>
<start>i did not necessarily feel a loss as the assault left a simple bet and evil war<end>
<start>nephis watch out for who you are trying to catch that is not going to do it<end>
<start>good then<end>
<start>it radiates<end>
<start>scratch the veins<end>
<start>sunny remains a saint so it would be weird if he was not approached by the other clans<end>
<start>stop thinking<end>
<start>and then after it is subjective to love characters or not except kai it is the best<end>
<start>the rest of the work hype me so crazy<end>
<start>i do not like pain<end>
<start>we have seen what is not on the hard one<end>
<start>gooper is not a day level fr but i also made a small reminder for those who read vo<end>
<start>the bourbers with his fault it was missing<end>
<start>ahubruh<end>
<start>between big quotes<end>
<start>psq jpense that if they do not go in the domain of one of the sovereigns<end>
<start>it is the light researcher the name of the baton i think i am more on<end>
<start>full agreement<end>
<start>okay i see<end>
<start>mrc for gray chaps<end>
<start>this is serious possible yeah<end>
<start>reel but i regret to have started so soon and not when it is already finished supercrygenk<end>
<start>i do not have a proper test i just have the number of views a week for this week seen that is all i have<end>
<start>so basically there would have been a possibility she would trust sunny<end>
<start>you get close to the truth<end>
<start>there are too many questions<end>
<start>he was a kid when he was<end>
<start>i think it will be pretty much the one otherwise if they come out in holy instant it will deregulate everything level ratio of force<end>
<start>not even in the house of the night<end>
<start>soon join your gang tkt<end>
<start>is what he would not have farmed the moon for leenglobe whole with his domain<end>
<start>neph made a metaphore on that in the and the last guy who was associated with the watery it was weaver<end>
<start>yeah sure<end>
<start>dark sasuke grave sour who loves that fighting<end>
<start>besides we know if the gods had children<end>
<start>i really do not see holy dying she is almost part of the cohort<end>
<start>i am not talking about the back weaving but just seeing nicely<end>
<start>fielon has funny interactions with saint and sunny<end>
<start>the story of closing the best arch of the work<end>
<start>nan cranberry<end>
<start>it is true what is so altruistic cassie laughs<end>
<start>well i think i am going to take a break for a week or two the bow on the groove is nice but i do not like the transitions that leave you on the end for - chap before i get the answer and it prevents me from prefixing the one of groove<end>
<start>since we are in the living room<end>
<start>advice no longer come here<end>
<start>just they are attracted by the doors<end>
<start>but then the nightmare exit would go in that direction<end>
<start>they are the most powerful saints of humanity<end>
<start>personal i am okay to say that cassie is a goat if she sees that she did not forget sunny<end>
<start>and we know if there is anything on top<end>
<start>whether it is sunny or bite they will always find a scumbag to get out<end>
<start>and has no capacity<end>
<start>the true men forgive directly<end>
<start>oh he comes from the shore forgets a general gunlaug maybe a guy who paid his tribe maybe<end>
<start>and an amazing translator<end>
<start>snake has bcq too much sah potential<end>
<start>it always does by the way<end>
<start>it is weird<end>
<start>we are going to try and give you a real answer<end>
<start>tsss<end>
<start>even anvil<end>
<start>but now we are doing well the raw power of saint is cool<end>
<start>and especially that mtn que nephis has its transformation is literally wings<end>
<start>jai my theory like that sunny will test one of the new soul snake ability that allows it brand certain person and i think that may be its might allow to bypass the attribute without destiny of the monk i would like to believe it<end>
<start>but the difference between the sunny and the other saints is so frightening wsh<end>
<start>i have done another one<end>
<start>but in general per day<end>
<start>you are talking about mountains<end>
<start>because i am not sure there is a lot to say about his fault<end>
<start>i had already talked about my theory<end>
<start>not just worms<end>
<start>he is always been like that<end>
<start>i am chapter more than<end>
<start>but also i wonder how he will be able to make tangible his domain because i think that in terms of shadow in his soul it is rather wide es what he will first have to learn to invoke them directly and that with the domain his will will be facilitated this possible j waits for theory on his confess<end>
<start>on the other hand nephis will remember the weaver mask no<end>
<start>we do not know if innumerables mean just fate or other fate<end>
<start>i will tell you that i do not understand much about it yet it is like the new door thing introduced i did not see the moment or it was explained<end>
<start>i suppose<end>
<start>you have to stop being sour like this is a good person<end>
<start>that is why i am never going here until i read the chaps of the day normally<end>
<start>and the nephis sunny recrose or someone and it announces a death<end>
<start>so unless she becomes ascending groove will have no default normally<end>
<start>ah and he fucks the winter bet be we waited for it but that damage we did not let do<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>just it must act normally with about ten corpd<end>
<start>we have already seen sunnu alcolikse<end>
<start>hotgrimm<end>
<start>i am assuming it is also where he got the weaver mask<end>
<start>i do not like it so i do not validate<end>
<start>it translates that free chaps<end>
<start>yeah that is what i was thinking but it will hurt me a lot especially when it is because they do not remember him anymore<end>
<start>there is nothing line<end>
<start>cassie is just impressive<end>
<start>can be just because he wants her to become stronger without putting her in great danger<end>
<start>we were too big mdr<end>
<start>you do not follow the rules<end>
<start>and yes<end>
<start>well people i am counting on you guys tonight<end>
<start>he did it recently<end>
<start>or kai or mordret or jet<end>
<start>if for supremacy one must refer to the description of aspect my theory is that the real domain of sunny is its subjects because its description of aspect makes reference to the relationship master elev so it must probably be its<end>
<start>we are going to have to wait for chap before we get the rest<end>
<start>yeah but there is only one where he can do it and when sunny stops the first time he talks about closing his eye<end>
<start>yeah there is going to be dead people in the next arcs on<end>
<start>she did not want to have the first nightmare<end>
<start>i am a man of peace give your explanations first<end>
<start>i think of something like her too but it is just that with the tps we are starting to know g<end>
<start>the volume is really amazing<end>
<start>there is even a world where i read everything<end>
<start>i deliberately abuse<end>
<start>so much a banger as a chapter i had a-do-re<end>
<start>immediately punished for<end>
<start>tamar is right the sortlege created nightmares to test the wakes the proof without sunny she would already dead in addition the sortlege provides much too much more<end>
<start>i am the first<end>
<start>i am assuming we do not see the fate of sunny<end>
<start>you kill me<end>
<start>i am saying shit<end>
<start>what a horror this app<end>
<start>mmh actually<end>
<start>next time goes down httpsdiscordcomchannels effie<end>
<start>i read it again but it is still a little blurry<end>
<start>demon of rest to let have a certain connection with the god of shadow because finally death and peace is rest not<end>
<start>for me he just needs preparation<end>
<start>return of trade ss tomorrow<end>
<start>next time goes down httpsdiscordcomchannels<end>
<start>a direct ruler<end>
<start>not in fact when you find yourself in the case of quentin who has lost his physical body in the real world when he finishes his second nightmare he wakes up directly in his citadel and can return directly to the real world but the concern that he will teleport his aleatoryly best to ask for the help of a saint who will transport him into the real world so that he can lay an anchor in the real world<end>
<start>it is because he does not like my valve<end>
<start>the sleeper who had deceived the senses of sunny a godgrave<end>
<start>thanks gray<end>
<start>that is it<end>
<start>and i am out of here before i get spoiled<end>
<start>thank you for these crazy chapters<end>
<start>she is going to fall for stuff that will fit her power so jackpot<end>
<start>sunny said the sensation when he looked at the carpenter's statue during the fight was the same as when we talked about strangers<end>
<start>he is still here<end>
<start>or an item to control time oh<end>
<start>i admit it is even a crazy sick person<end>
<start>or i would be super sad<end>
<start>do not read diagonally take your time and enjoy the work<end>
<start>but good<end>
<start>a day all the time you wait to trad chapters to read them<end>
<start>in real life i think no more than a few months will go very fast given the potential for destruction of weapons i think<end>
<start>and has high speed the without dec sunny that makes a cake nephis that finishes it before talking about killing a silly god a little blocks<end>
<start>but then maybe it is his domain and he is got it with the door<end>
<start>after the better you settle the more you enjoy it makes sense<end>
<start>but making ineffective the action of lecturing lost light for anyone it would change the essence even of its dark slave aspect<end>
<start>that is right i am sad thrill<end>
<start>like they would be more hostages in their field<end>
<start>and hope after the winter beast<end>
<start>so cassie pre tomb was aware of what was going to happen to sunny this crazy<end>
<start>well the first wills differ<end>
<start>well that is what i said<end>
<start>and by the way logically she should very quickly see sunny who is the blight of these false visions<end>
<start>i am going to have to wait until the end of the flight not already i will read the chaps<end>
<start>the fact that he is already seen himself in fear is almost on<end>
<start>well then i do not have the necessary qualifications<end>
<start>because we do not have names i think<end>
<start>yeah he sold his soul for that xd<end>
<start>when i think it is almost quarter of the volume in advance<end>
<start>i think because we have no god's name<end>
<start>yeah but it was a temporary cohort they were the only since about chap<end>
<start>it is limit on my opinion a sovereign cannot kill a cursed creature because the gap between the ranks is getting bigger and bigger<end>
<start>he is already a godgrave so good<end>
<start>finally if<end>
<start>yeah okay<end>
<start>good for the job<end>
<start>in any case the sunny of the future said he was not really alive and we see a ring<end>
<start>which is legit<end>
<start>it is true that the asterion bow would be genial<end>
<start>she would have spent years doing everything she could to make it happen like it is taking risks etc so that in the end sunny could wash her a bof not envy and that it serves nothing<end>
<start>that is how many already<end>
<start>um i did not understand it as his<end>
<start>so you get me something<end>
<start>i think the shadow thing is going ahead logically and that is exactly what gave a breakie the way to remember if we start from the principle that she knows<end>
<start>transcendent terror<end>
<start>and for those who have not understood the end of the chapter with the importance of the person it will be said that nephis already asked a lot of question about the lord of shadows who learned his style of person and that as by chance take me again if i am wrong but a certain person has written a report of exploration on simply the tomb of ariel so i think that nephis has already begun to make a connection between the lord of shadows and the tomb perhaps of the theories in addition to his head<end>
<start>kai has not brought enough to history yet to make her death really impacting<end>
<start>i admit i do not understand the queen's powers too much<end>
<start>waouh waouh waouh waouh i just learned that the crazy prince is back in the pass to become sunny<end>
<start>yeah he is almost immortal<end>
<start>for me the most logical would be that kai dies<end>
<start>knowing that every world has god is possible<end>
<start>someone has a fanart cali de mortret for a friend who wants to start<end>
<start>personal when i finished all ia direct start again i am end of volume<end>
<start>and sunny would have made his choice by being aware of the risks<end>
<start>not so much as it is actually close enough to a citadel and it is still the domain of song<end>
<start>spoil of the last volume but we have a magnificent image on the boat's guilthythree serv in the vortex<end>
<start>actually mb it is not neph talking but she has no reaction when sunny talks about it<end>
<start>or not in any way we are not ready to get the answer<end>
<start>anyway for both of us we are going to have something incredible between cassie who might remember some things and nephis<end>
<start>the attention is what had to burn on the wood tip<end>
<start>and i think outside of neph and sunny he loses against no one<end>
<start>and i fully agree with revenge<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewultra-space-pheromosa-pokemon-queen-beast-gif-<end>
<start>for me volume<end>
<start>sunny and neph are probably much stronger than was anvil and song as saint<end>
<start>i think it is basically something unpredictable<end>
<start>at that time anyway<end>
<start>a great friendie fielon and sunny<end>
<start>we have all guessed more or less already<end>
<start>sorry i will read it again to appreciate your trade<end>
<start>mdrrrrr is passion nephis<end>
<start>without risk of dying<end>
<start>in terms of power yes i think<end>
<start>she too i imagine<end>
<start>so it can change the fate of others<end>
<start>but i was expecting so much else<end>
<start>okay so the end got you a little crazy but you found the rest of it i see<end>
<start>see how<end>
<start>i think anvil is somehow aware of the existence of sunny because if he touches the memory of neph he saw that she was modified but she does not know by whom he knows that there is indeed one last person who made the nightmare with neph and the cohort but that nobody remembers<end>
<start>like i would like to buy books it does not exist<end>
<start>thank you for the answer<end>
<start>this merite the trad is nickel<end>
<start>it is the only divine artifact that it possesses memory no<end>
<start>i do not see how cassie can be more convincing than future sunny<end>
<start>aster<end>
<start>i really like the way to write g<end>
<start>tkt i recommend you reread certain step in case<end>
<start>but it is just that jet we can see that she does not have a home with all the souls she is raised except for effie and kai apart from the basic power up when we become holy i see not much else<end>
<start>yeah that is right<end>
<start>daeron<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewreal-life-batman-gif-<end>
<start>do not forget that the world is in a hurry with the nightmare chain she is probably going to end up on other continents in barely a year ago superior monsters that appear so i let you imagine the crazy things that will appear<end>
<start>we do not know what anvil can do with these epees<end>
<start>he is already past the word number<end>
<start>with this blush of appearance they have their default<end>
<start>effie effie effie but then she irrecoverable fuck laughs hutaofacepalm<end>
<start>fucking want to read it all again with current knowledge<end>
<start>because a lost destiny or lost from fate would be style<end>
<start>true xd<end>
<start>holy it is really dark that i do not want to see dying i prefer to see kai die that holy xd<end>
<start>even if it is close enough to a citadel it is not necessarily mega clean<end>
<start>yeah after you know the source of the memory you know its level<end>
<start>jsp<end>
<start>and in addition it can send daeron etc<end>
<start>yeah okay that is what i was thinking<end>
<start>it is not that bad but it does not hurt when it is too bad<end>
<start>pfff everyone should know how to read braille yet shibalaugh i cannot read it either<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewpocao-magica-gif-<end>
<start>if her target has tens of thousands of nuclei yes she isuseless<end>
<start>x<end>
<start>if he recovers snake he has the shade sword nn<end>
<start>she accepted because what wanted to get memories of sunny especially<end>
<start>not because he could be corrupted because of her asking me not why because his still a mystery at present<end>
<start>on the other hand mtn the film of the forgotten shore looks like vrm to reality without sunny mdr<end>
<start>no need to learn weaving etc hop it does to you when you kill monsters<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>there is also a world or sunny will make her wish and everyone turns their backs on her after nan<end>
<start>determination may be<end>
<start>bahahahaha<end>
<start>i have a question<end>
<start>this is why there are divine attacks<end>
<start>i am missing guys<end>
<start>he kept an eye on them<end>
<start>yeah but i still do not see how he can win against mordet<end>
<start>i would have thought a real potential for the person is the only one in the night house to present<end>
<start>one does not go without the other<end>
<start>but her looks bad guys<end>
<start>yes on webnovel i pay to read them<end>
<start>bah he is immortal so logical that he wants to die<end>
<start>we have to forgive our dear cassia she has no hatred our saint<end>
<start>the fact that it becomes a natural wake could prevent cassia from perceiving its attributes<end>
<start>vrm i exploded with the revelation<end>
<start>yes i wait for the meeting of her sanctuary and discover that she sees nothing with such impatience<end>
<start>those figs she who was so big<end>
<start>maybe it is seishan so we did not get a lot of information about her and she was freaking sunny<end>
<start>the rappell will do it alone when he arrives in their first cuchmar it will not be their faith in a false deese that will save them<end>
<start>i think he is theorized about the most likely things but he is out of control<end>
<start>but we do not have any appearance yet in the first nightmare so how could he have let go<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewkicking-out-get-out-outta-here-gif-<end>
<start>like that kind of thing<end>
<start>i want the opposite<end>
<start>normally it will be the strongest in v jpense<end>
<start>after i say that because to pass by awaken naturally you can recover gasoline from a person awake<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewyes-clapping-applause-praise-gif-<end>
<start>i do not believe it but we will see<end>
<start>bah i think that the person who sent a message in the dream of ananke and who led indirectly sunny and nephis to the boat is the tormentor aka cassia of the future<end>
<start>pile of no connection to the shadow god yet ten has a<end>
<start>nan it is gray that translated so much to catch up with the author's rhythm<end>
<start>just to snatch guys here or i would be a little sad<end>
<start>later i think<end>
<start>they came out of it<end>
<start>i confess<end>
<start>or the mad prince<end>
<start>ah fielon<end>
<start>i just saw that you just finished the book too and it is in pain together man<end>
<start>i personally find that it would be too simple to explain everything like that actually i am weaver and i have foreseen my entire existence<end>
<start>see if he is ready to let her get hurt a max<end>
<start>this is the least dev of the cohort<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewanime-moon-souleater-nature-horror-gif-<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>he will not let go of the piece<end>
<start>shadow is part of this<end>
<start>i am wrong but it will surprise me bcp<end>
<start>i do not think so master or holy it remains a divine shadow<end>
<start>jsp if we realize but it is monstrous<end>
<start>in tt case perso jveux see him live in the anxious expectation of seeing rain in his nightmare<end>
<start>he is the only one to see the time that reverses at the beginning of nightmares i think yet<end>
<start>or it is pretty much that since she did not see anything she took it that it was sunny<end>
<start>she was hesitating from her family she was half going but was afraid<end>
<start>well you got it<end>
<start>by the way miles thank you gray for these chapters translated you are vrm a boss<end>
<start>i misspoke she says she cannot see the avatar shadow when she should as the avatar thought so she must already know that master sunny shadow<end>
<start>something is worth it or it is transition<end>
<start>then i do not think she will live her nightmare without sunny being the one<end>
<start>ellipse serves this<end>
<start>and with body<end>
<start>you said too much blasphemy to our saint<end>
<start>but i do not understand when he says he lost his body<end>
<start>yes really already the cursed terror i think he will come back to kill her at some point<end>
<start>the reuf he masters the multicloning mdr<end>
<start>or i will shove<end>
<start>prince of nothing it is either a nickname he gave himself or his real name we are not sure<end>
<start>you finished reading the volume<end>
<start>you are asking for a lot of shibalaugh<end>
<start>i would perhaps render my verdict at the end of the volume<end>
<start>mdr pov asterion<end>
<start>for the big battle with the sovereigns and tt<end>
<start>wesh what is this power of boon<end>
<start>i over-kiffeed this interrogation vrm mrc gray for this exit regularite and this quality trad<end>
<start>yup also works in note tqt x<end>
<start>fielon transcendent rising nightmare<end>
<start>there are rules in this living room a policy that all those who frequent the living room know it is clear and precise here every time a new reader wants to be spoiled and especially who asks the person present tells him to go read and discover by himself<end>
<start>but dcp in itself they can get out of the nightmare at any time in real life this nightmare is completely isolated from the timeline outside dcp everything is possible<end>

<start>my dream that the attack on the first researcher is happening in full offscreen<end>

<start>the way does not take you is just indescribable<end>
<start>mb<end>
<start>so jsp<end>
<start>in any case i also appreciated your experiences throughout the work<end>
<start>there is a chance but good<end>
<start>it understands it is so good a guy in this brute world<end>
<start>theories that will leave when we get his capa<end>
<start>but yeah it is a crazy thing<end>
<start>but must tell them cassy<end>
<start>you think it means what the fact that her soul shines stronger<end>
<start>little question regarding the godgrave ruin originally godgrave was built in the kingdom of dreams or was absorbed by that<end>
<start>i do not see him doing his personal<end>
<start>and better speak of nightmare<end>
<start>caster<end>
<start>moreover anvil can observe the fight with the sword<end>
<start>yes but the problem is we still do not know if she is lying or not saying her<end>
<start>yes they are in all<end>
<start>i hate everything<end>
<start>already when i suppose kai is probably the famous lord of terror<end>
<start>so already all that touches a sunny is dead she sees him more<end>
<start>tell you that maybe it is dumpling the antagonist laughs<end>
<start>she knows when and how all her companions will die<end>
<start>gray i already told you i liked you bcp<end>
<start>like i think he is going to almost die and go back<end>
<start>i am waiting for something we finally see that is asterion<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewjust-be-patient-ryan-locke-seaway-mrs-david-song-just-wait-for-a-bit-gif-<end>
<start>i stay on the effie one<end>
<start>it took divine attributes the visions of cassia a plan in beton arm to beat one<end>
<start>maybe she does not remember a saint but just the image she represents for her<end>
<start>at least one sacred aspect<end>
<start>the cafe it brings tune<end>
<start>oe but we are fr here<end>
<start>he weaved the outfall of destiny but jsp if he made fate himself<end>
<start>okay we understand her then<end>
<start>you can speak quickly or not<end>
<start>laugh at him<end>
<start>in my top<end>
<start>i guess you are done with the v-cup x<end>
<start>i thought it was just holy etc<end>
<start>in real jsis curious crazy but jpense it will be the post sovereign zone<end>
<start>but broken though really shibalaugh<end>
<start>restaurant mdrr<end>
<start>hello i have a question you have stats on the number of readings per chapter like an average to have an indicator of the number of french to follow ss<end>
<start>pq naeve<end>
<start>i love the title of the<end>
<start>o i see<end>
<start>we had a jet to catch the other shadow user<end>
<start>the volume is finished in vf the or still not<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrr<end>
<start>and then we leave the fight as it is mtn<end>
<start>without seeing the end<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>it has become a emote on the g-serv<end>
<start>it seems difficult but not so impossible<end>
<start>so far we have nothing<end>
<start>sunny running away on her own<end>
<start>he may not have lost everything but i do not think there is any interface to the exit leg anymore<end>
<start>i imagine the discussions at school i threw a fighting dog in case i was then attacked by a transcendent terror also known as the seignzur of the shadows which is one of the most powerful saints of tt the tps<end>
<start>and the lake of tears makes me think a bit of the islands<end>
<start>he even tells him<end>
<start>personal i think more than asterion to the heart line as you said his power is bound to the souls<end>
<start>well we will have the tps to reflect with the break force<end>
<start>you think sunny will come back to lepee<end>
<start>effie and jet are not bad but kai<end>
<start>i am reading<end>
<start>like for her she could have met him at the same time as neph because they spawn by the side<end>
<start>if it were to do a favor he would not be here like that<end>
<start>we just do not know where he came from<end>
<start>sunny training for the wake without the exit ohv ohv ohv ohv<end>
<start>ehhh broo<end>
<start>at any time it decides to go bz the winter beast<end>
<start>i imagine something much more gloomy<end>
<start>what is her name already<end>
<start>this but especially now it is almost like a trade deal so you will have a quiet mind on it it is a week and readers will see nothing so there is not really a bad score<end>
<start>okkkkkkk<end>
<start>i thought it was a long time ago<end>
<start>those who are a day the them nightmare is finished or not yet<end>
<start>and pq just rip off his real name<end>
<start>but how does that actually affect her<end>
<start>kappa<end>
<start>i am too bright<end>
<start>maybe it will change no<end>
<start>if we explain it to you it is all right<end>
<start>and if you do not you think sunny's going to have a new real name or it is going to stay the same<end>
<start>i know<end>
<start>as usual<end>
<start>it took it to be wiped out of existence for it to advance ptdrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>with what is happening it almost looks like its attribute comes back<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewgay-pride-trap-twink-femboy-gif-<end>
<start>deso of the pave i had bcq on consciousness and spirit after reading the chap<end>
<start>plus the real world will be little by little sent into the world of nightmares<end>
<start>in tt case i felt more like an early flight<end>
<start>he watches the convs from the shadow he protects gotham<end>
<start>bah biter it works like sunny globally no<end>
<start>i never said otherwise<end>
<start>i say that there is a very simple way to break the sin of loneliness all by making it a minimum profitable to sunny<end>
<start>there are circumstances that make that if an unclean beast appears on earth it disappears and if a dormant titan appears on earth it disappears<end>
<start>o but i have been a long time i should have been<end>
<start>mdr ptet that it is just to piss off sunny mdrr<end>
<start>he saw her again and she does not remember him but she did not push him back he could have talked to him etc<end>
<start>he is spying on me<end>
<start>we do not know if he has anything to do with the oblivion daemon<end>
<start>oh oh finally the relationship between sunny and nephis takes on more beautiful the turn of events is tasty if i can say<end>
<start>after that just that i am debile<end>
<start>jy thinks average too but his does theory that are possible even if unlikely<end>
<start>i think that by trying to find a way to either free his father or find a way to totally eliminate him he caused the seal to weaken<end>
<start>top fleau remains solid ptdrrrrr<end>
<start>but the chain breaker is down there so either there is alone with or they are all going there and for one reason or another sunny was still the<end>
<start>it says when it psq i have no memory<end>
<start>nonnnn<end>
<start>happily that is the basic reason of the exitlege<end>
<start>nightmare is really the horse he thinks he is<end>
<start>he did not do anything shibalaugh<end>
<start>there is no way it is anything else<end>
<start>it put you in the last chapter of the volume after<end>
<start>less obviously<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewtoriwori-yasswon-wonbinanti-upset-throwing-a-fit-gif-<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewluffy-nami-wano-one-piece-gif-<end>
<start>agree that it rains because it wakes up and its aspect binds to the light rain see even god of thunderstorm unlikely<end>
<start>nephis jpense what is immortal in real life<end>
<start>genus that clones have shadow shells etc at the same time<end>
<start>as always<end>
<start>you do not have a line if you do not happen again<end>
<start>i think that the angel's status will be when he is a sacred<end>
<start>he is gone and then ripped off his real name<end>
<start>to forget the shore<end>
<start>yes but no<end>
<start>let me read after<end>
<start>i swear x<end>
<start>on the other hand nephis that ignites all the riviere while usually she is hyper calm shibalaugh<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewrocket-league-save-epic-jusblazearmy-gif-<end>
<start>she knows how lonely he felt<end>
<start>but she is not a big girl<end>
<start>it would make someone feel guilty about giving them up<end>
<start>nan it is not real excuses but it shows that she regrets crazy<end>
<start>she said they did not have a nightmare but i am not sure about the looks<end>
<start>nan on the other hand i find it really annoying to spoil them on the wiki<end>
<start>i think what also loses as holy<end>
<start>besides maybe i am saying shit but sunny did not change the memory at all<end>
<start>then the level of the dark dance is the snake rank currently it is corrupted whereas the class of sunny that is to say terror is it directly connects to the snake class<end>
<start>bah i think the shadow only reponded because sunny was carrying the divine aspect of his domain and therefore eligible to his heritage line outside that i see no other reasons that could have pushed him to help sunny so for the other gods it is the same they did not really have neither need nor interest<end>
<start>the you become a wake in the physical sense with gas etc<end>
<start>yeah she is just in the spoilers<end>
<start>tell you that when you get to the end there will still be chapters every day for a long time<end>
<start>spends at least the night before starting v mdrrrr<end>
<start>how anvil drills gold tear<end>
<start>well that is shit<end>
<start>there are already exits every day<end>
<start>it must be a sunny theory or i invent it then ptdrrrrr<end>
<start>then<end>
<start>yeah what it looks like the part of the nightmare is dantesque<end>
<start>or have claimed territory that has not yet been claimed<end>
<start>waiting i would just think about something we had not had a talk like before we went master you have to have the monk unlock his appearance and something that sovereign needs a real name<end>
<start>so in a few ways they should share the world<end>
<start>he is already in a hehe vac<end>
<start>i am a fanboy of noctis<end>
<start>remains to confess to him that they had night appointments shimaaugh<end>
<start>nan<end>
<start>so how she is cassied to know that sunny is the weapon against the destiny she created and that is why everyone forgot about her<end>
<start>even without destiny the cornercides are present<end>
<start>may be that cassia of the pass and or the tormentor have somehow made an attempt to keep sunny in memory if they knew what was going to happen<end>
<start>we learn about him on the trade or not<end>
<start>fun<end>
<start>in real life i laugh that half<end>
<start>reincarnates as a demonic gladiator in a magical world the exact title<end>
<start>on<end>
<start>so i think as long as they have not found it there is no default vrmt<end>
<start>but as he became stronger<end>
<start>um sunny is very likely the sahrain teacher but<end>
<start>i cannot wait to die just for that kid<end>
<start>knower looks like<end>
<start>he will take the potatoes of the future<end>
<start>well yes even<end>
<start>i know very well that this debate is no use to shibalaugh<end>
<start>nope the most recent thing is fanart<end>
<start>incredible fighting<end>
<start>o i think so too<end>
<start>yes you see if a moment he is alone in ect depression<end>
<start>he sends a message to the groin saying life is pleasant after the death of quentin<end>
<start>in other words it is less than waiting for the defacto potential of the song or just that rain leaves the domain nothing will happen<end>
<start>those who are today speak in dm not on the chanel if there is a spoil it is almost all the time a mistake i think<end>
<start>i had no other name for pokemon<end>
<start>but then gg a axel and a beko that came out of zinzin theories<end>
<start>cassie forgets all<end>
<start>ahhhhh bah yes i had zappe<end>
<start>pepethink<end>
<start>jet fights abominations every day since she worked for the guv some saints were already afraid of her as master i think that level experience and level power it is not bad<end>
<start>only wn is allowed to post it en fr<end>
<start>god the chapter<end>
<start>and uh he did not pass the maze<end>
<start>there is been a lot of bows everywhere<end>
<start>it does not get confused with skin<end>
<start>chapter an attack on the soul can make qqun hollow that it is not awakened awaken master asterion therefore kill the mother of neph what would explain the incoherences of the official version of the line asterion of the god of the heart of the souls<end>
<start>an aspect related to shadows is possible but i cannot see it would already have the line<end>
<start>conquer citadelle<end>
<start>positive<end>
<start>there is a titan dechu dying in front of sunny we say it is really cool destiny shibalaugh<end>
<start>because he lost the exit leg<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewnoob-olydri-mmorpg-mmo-artheon-gif-<end>
<start>you see that kind of tricky detail since she asked her a question in qq so he has to answer no<end>
<start>after a nightmare you can just hide to the end and if the scenario goes in your direction you can do it without doing anything like not helping noctis and hiding until everything happens<end>
<start>destiny still exists<end>
<start>it seems to me that his after he is recyou seen that to create an echo he has to sacrifice a soul nuclei who means he created it when he recyou his monster nuclei<end>
<start>in real life it gives you a little time to be up to date<end>
<start>not impossible<end>
<start>the description does not speak of the domain of daeron it speaks of a authority on the water that will be granted to the domain here of shadows<end>
<start>little<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewee-gif-<end>
<start>so if the next chapter is as good we are going to feast<end>
<start>the problem that you just learned part of the problem but i assure you you will have more explanation about the end of the volume and if you still have any questions even after the end of the old volume we can explain everything to you as best we can<end>
<start>if it passes transcendent and happens the same thing as for kai increasing the rank of the aspect<end>
<start>yeah but it does not appear in the runes<end>
<start>not necessarily a feeling but something he would implant in people's shadows<end>
<start>sunny jin woo<end>
<start>after that is just my opinion i wanted to share i am not the translator so i do not know if it is really better<end>
<start>and mtn more than ever we could compare nephis to an angel with its transformation and sunny at the time had no capacity to really control bcp shadow<end>
<start>during dry i thought cassie had invited them to a stage on the events of the ro<end>
<start>me in zeroid plutot<end>
<start>sunny was supposed to bring him some arrows<end>
<start>bah there will be little of the equivalents as bitten by those who line it from the gods in itself<end>
<start>he is going to lose and his friends' trust and he is going to keep the shadow bond<end>
<start>it takes an aspect to pass saintly i believe<end>
<start>and otherwise they can still join the government to limit the break<end>
<start>i may be a maso but still do not know what it is like when sunny loses a shadow or a shadow<end>
<start>this is exactly the same discussion that we had at the time it is too serious<end>
<start>thank you for the chap gray<end>
<start>i have to go ahead but i do not want to catch up on the last chapter and wait every day<end>
<start>on a certain person on the site i do not want any comment about him emiliahappy<end>
<start>eng<end>
<start>time<end>
<start>that is to say the madness of the work<end>
<start>he is had his nightmare<end>
<start>if the real gods had cyou were the deamon had one or something like that<end>
<start>my theory is that oblivion is bound to the forgotten god mentioned by eurys but it is not even confirmation that every daemon is bound to a god<end>
<start>mmh not false<end>
<start>i am afraid i will know what is next<end>
<start>yes he cannot be moved<end>
<start>he has the answer to everything<end>
<start>it is the volume that will change the work and it makes it special the same title that the shore forgets<end>
<start>yeah but it will be less powerful<end>
<start>i am in trouble<end>
<start>there must be a good fight but yes i think she gets beaten<end>
<start>jet is jet<end>
<start>it was her way of being forgiven to give back the choice to sunny to take back her life choice that she had taken away from her and she regrets it<end>
<start>he did not destroy the soul or take possession just he is there without anyone knowing<end>
<start>sunny who makes a me when i reincarnate<end>
<start>my hand theory is that he will return with neph in the pyramid to regain his destiny<end>
<start>dead his power is decuple<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>ptdr sunny the magnanimous<end>
<start>personal i think it is pretty much that he decided to call prince of nothing because he was done by valor and he had nothing left<end>
<start>not as if it would change something after<end>
<start>it has a relationship in the sense or it is just dark but no connection between the weaving of shadow and the god of shadow i am going to<end>
<start>on the other hand she will be pretty impressive for a wake<end>
<start>after pikachu he is the best friend of sacha<end>
<start>ahahah<end>
<start>between the moment he talks about the sovereign he killed and the moment he assumes that the girls of the song drink incredible blood<end>
<start>the loss of destiny and oblivion<end>
<start>although i do not know i guess<end>
<start>she is not top top and not finished<end>
<start>keep reading and you will have your answer to your question<end>
<start>he is more subject to the exitlee<end>
<start>after they do not know he went to make his same nightmare with the cohort<end>
<start>more bitter seems to know a package on nether<end>
<start>ahh yes ok thanks<end>
<start>many like this bow because we finally have a sunny solo that carries<end>
<start>yeah with his lease of lower dream kingdom<end>
<start>it is just his name<end>

<start>he is driving us crazy<end>
<start>nuke more shade beside<end>
<start>while in addition kai is the least dev perso of the cohort<end>
<start>hate to see how sunny's going to get off without memory<end>
<start>i have a bad memory i do not remember what i said<end>
<start>you say that after you said you got spoiled<end>
<start>no idea<end>
<start>poh her crazy as it is going to be<end>
<start>he is too far away from it he does not get the bluetooth<end>
<start>the question that is always hanging me or is the fucking volume iv<end>
<start>i tremble like a dead leaf<end>
<start>she remembers sunny but she comes years after mdrr<end>
<start>bitrett he will cook the perso still goes up in my esteem sah i hope even more than he will ally to sunny afterwards cbpray<end>
<start>the first nightmare it can infect anyone in theory<end>
<start>yeah the most logical thing with the info that had<end>
<start>i have books in progress without counting the novel on this or that pc<end>
<start>we are holding it down a little bit so it is going through<end>
<start>yes but its potential increases dramatically if it ever uses it would be what sunny at the same time<end>
<start>true<end>
<start>in the same tps you want to do against a transcendent cockroach that clones itself<end>
<start>the aura of introduction<end>
<start>and orv<end>
<start>and also bird thief is perhaps one of the most intelligent characters of the work he succeeded in using the particularity of the pyramid and the sortlege of sunny to rise again after thousands of dannees<end>
<start>moreover we never had wind of any half-god if<end>
<start>if i can find out that vrmt actually call me weaver<end>
<start>mrc for chaps<end>
<start>she remembers more saintly we agree<end>
<start>a kind of angel of con jense<end>
<start>he would have said to you she would begaye loud<end>
<start>cassie the rest<end>
<start>it would be wild<end>
<start>but it is going to be too much fun to see the other cassie bitch again aha no<end>
<start>i have too much to see how the shadows will interact with him and whether they will respect him more<end>
<start>mmh possible is true<end>
<start>if she is in there she will hit some chess with weaver right now<end>
<start>amazing<end>
<start>yeah but that is not an interest<end>
<start>you want him to have no friends<end>
<start>he probably will not need a gun in the immediate since he will have his shadows<end>
<start>thank you gray nephis<end>
<start>where the epee is the center<end>
<start>filthy swelling<end>
<start>they do not need protection<end>
<start>i do not know<end>

<start>httpstenorcomviewsweaty-speedrunner-gif-<end>
<start>compared to the moment when she wished her a happy birthday jme said that as sunny was outside the tapestry the cassy scene worked more<end>
<start>sunny he is out of the exitlege never<end>
<start>his fits perfectly so much that i felt stupid not thinking about it<end>
<start>it is the existence of sunny or all that is tied to him<end>
<start>then his rank changes how<end>
<start>ahh but man we did not end up with the no-name cassie laughing laughs<end>
<start>thanks for the chappppppppps<end>

<start>already the nephis spy if he gets to make a gun like that it is going to be crushed<end>
<start>yes but nether has no line<end>
<start>every day jcrois<end>
<start>he is done too much crazy he is telling us his banal<end>
<start>for me<end>
<start>i started the i thought maybe she is trying to do like sunny oh crazy theory fortunately that she was not confirmed seconds after<end>
<start>i cry to laugh it is so petty<end>
<start>he was a sunny tyrant<end>
<start>it is just a virus left by a bit of weaver brains<end>
<start>who do you call the antarctic band<end>
<start>in any case this do not we can be on it that sunny will win this war shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>i mean new no it is a few weeks ago even though<end>
<start>well for me it is over but askip nan so i did not get it<end>
<start>we do not just know that his future version regrets his choice<end>
<start>terrible<end>
<start>it is a little less than ten pages of memory<end>
<start>mrc for chapters<end>
<start>it is made by an ia<end>
<start>we stole his destiny so he must have or must have had a fake sunny because otherwise who saved people in antarticque etc<end>
<start>he probably has the line of the cyou are and everything that goes with it<end>
<start>after being returned to anvil by asterion<end>
<start>after the stage must be smaller than with a classical saint<end>
<start>the sunny of the future is not the sunny of the future<end>
<start>but the question is<end>
<start>it is the bird<end>
<start>style but groove is older than sunny<end>
<start>i knew it already<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>a person<end>
<start>when you think it is over yen is still<end>
<start>well that is it<end>
<start>he will not have to do like the big sovereigns<end>
<start>genus shadow slave shippuden<end>
<start>i wonder if one day a volume will be better than the<end>
<start>mrc for chaps ohv<end>
<start>but askip tt the divine lines have already been found except that of shadow we know<end>
<start>effie is really the beauf of service<end>
<start>i will check your com xd<end>
<start>i think the thing i most want to see is the field of cassia<end>
<start>yes but mostly spoil<end>
<start>overall it seems to me rather complex ptdrrrr<end>
<start>the clifenger<end>
<start>sunny who says that something is powerful<end>
<start>i do it when i do a big session pc<end>
<start>and jet sets them both speed<end>
<start>it is too hype sry<end>
<start>if it finds itself in a flat desert without shadow it can even make the she will<end>
<start>is the domain literally an area that it dominates or is it a concept that they master<end>
<start>he is got his face broken by no one knows what<end>
<start>it is not when you get holy<end>
<start>the others are known enough to hide it<end>
<start>mordret<end>
<start>i am so not rushing to finish<end>
<start>we do not know if she was aware of the exact consequences but in any way it would have absolutely nothing to change<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthe-flash-keaton-batman-batwing-power-up-gif-<end>
<start>everywhere where there is bono it happens to me<end>
<start>you are sad that snake did not die<end>
<start>lapres nightmare when sunny will lose each of her friends and end up alone or in collab with mordret jy thinks<end>
<start>i hate sunny more times than cassie<end>
<start>he wants everything<end>
<start>always spying on us x<end>
<start>the real names are a population of cells so if you take a nephis hair and clone it that makes a second person for the same real name<end>
<start>this guy's too strong and too sneaky<end>
<start>normal<end>
<start>with effie that adds to it<end>
<start>there is a blur<end>
<start>the chapters are too funny<end>
<start>and it is back for a ride<end>
<start>for the moment yeah but after when they are going to become sacred then divine would well require the rest of the cohort to follow after<end>
<start>even though i preferred the previous volumes<end>
<start>in real it is a shame i would love to know the dapres bearings<end>
<start>ah careffie did not know the epine when they met again and yet he used it often it seemed to me<end>
<start>there you go<end>
<start>she wants to stop the end of the world<end>
<start>those who spawn in the morning go read my pave i confess i would like to have answers on his because jai bcq question and i think ya way that some pts of the theory be true cbcattoblush<end>
<start>g but not often details like this for nothing<end>
<start>just junior<end>
<start>heartache<end>
<start>it was talking about something that had shit with cassia towards the end of the volume<end>
<start>but nan the fall of falcon scott<end>
<start>they are going to want to get rid of him cv send it first line<end>
<start>this already confirmed before<end>
<start>i do not hope but i am afraid of something like this happened when it happened<end>
<start>yep it depends on personal expectations i know i love the change of pov it brings so much to a work and it is the black beast of ss<end>
<start>bahhh pq not xd<end>
<start>we do not know that<end>
<start>so he does not see a great terror killing in duel in bad conditions<end>
<start>i see her more in a question of revengedestruction than purification but each his point of view<end>
<start>she is going to have a little doubt like her master and a shadow and a guy gets called the shadow lord<end>
<start>i am talking between weaver or the guy who owned the boat in the second nightmare<end>
<start>it can absorb the fragment<end>
<start>sublime with your trad it is going to be a petite<end>
<start>besides if anyone could enlighten me on this part because i did not understand the spectrum it is the crazy prince<end>
<start>because it is when even strange that nephis as a sovereign came and disappeared like this<end>
<start>maybe an anvil wound like a spee<end>
<start>with its citadel not far<end>
<start>and for me i suppose that during the years missing in the chronology after the same nightmare sunny discovered something in my opinion it is becoming this god forgets or the god who is the origin of the nightmare i do not know why i have this idea in mind it is of course that a intuition<end>
<start>if he is able to invoke the monsters he killed<end>
<start>if a divine domain does not make you pass supreme i do not think an upper domain does<end>
<start>but he loses what exactly it means more appearance heritage and everything<end>
<start>he is gone crazy again but sweeter<end>
<start>now that you say it is true that it is at the end of the first nightmare that it is passed to the divine rank<end>
<start>avatars are the shadows of sunny so as usual they can do stuff them mm but they cannot talk<end>
<start>in the same nightmare<end>
<start>no we see that in order to labsorb it has to break it<end>
<start>bah the father of noctambule is the grandfather of neave of the coup<end>
<start>she had at least one suspicion that this might happen<end>
<start>sunny still has to appear in the original film of a song of light and tenebres so if cassie manages to make the rapprochement she can create a piece of theater in integral sunny i think<end>
<start>fucking but crazy banger in fact<end>
<start>well like just mtn she knows the story of sunny<end>
<start>not for the lord of fear his orders sound like a mental attack the proof when sunny used the crown to cancel his powers his grace has enchanted who made sunny crazy but who immunizes against mental attack<end>
<start>like i think more than if he is washing he is going to ask to be his equal<end>
<start>infinite as sunless<end>
<start>tema<end>
<start>ah anytime she spent years spying on people in a couple with her ability shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>a good reading that awaits that i recognize<end>
<start>then you can ping to know<end>
<start>if cassie made the rapprochement between sunny and the lantarctic devil it is just sadism to make her see this shibalaugh piece<end>
<start>keep reading because i feel like you are going to eat a dry spoil if you keep talking to us<end>
<start>shibalaugh smokingtier but without exitlege how it will evolve genre to become a titan for example<end>
<start>jpense my fav remains fighting vs bitert<end>
<start>because you think he had his face after he wanted to kill everyone<end>
<start>on the other hand he has no interest in deceiving just a good question<end>
<start>human<end>
<start>shadows<end>
<start>httpsforgotten-shorenotionsiteshadow-slave-efacebcccbdcda<end>
<start>the honor would be when we were getting hit on our fingers when we did not spoil<end>
<start>jsp jme say ptet it will play a role for now where they will remember who sunny is<end>
<start>do not believe<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewsuma-gif-<end>
<start>the traders can very well just buy provisions to wakes that they make the trip<end>
<start>but there is a way it is more complex than that<end>
<start>he said he did not remember<end>
<start>i think sunny talked about it even in the second nightmare<end>
<start>rain waking<end>
<start>gerait is a great word shibalagh<end>
<start>i do not know if you know what i mean<end>
<start>we all wish him good luck<end>
<start>arc nd nightmare i find it the best person<end>
<start>they have the same name<end>
<start>yes but you know what i mean saints that are worth if it is not anymore i find it weird especially that effie and kai even if they are strong they are not at the level of those who have divine aspects and everything<end>
<start>but he is got access to the paycheck to avoid just guys spoiling here under cover of theory<end>
<start>he is suffered enough poor man<end>
<start>nan an epee mdr<end>
<start>after according to my interpretation she discovers it a few seconds in advance that is why she is surprised<end>
<start>finished volume<end>
<start>then how did i say that so that you could get closer to our former companion who was probably in love with you before being erased<end>
<start>he asks if qq gets a lady fragment<end>
<start>hutaoworry<end>
<start>cbcattochristian<end>
<start>but we agree nephis does not look really annoying it just looks like she is doing it to respect her principles<end>
<start>yep that is what i think too it is just to get your opinions x<end>
<start>yeah i think so too<end>
<start>but for the rest it could not explain the coincidences too large or some scenaristic ease<end>
<start>liar<end>
<start>i found a theory and i like it if you want<end>
<start>the memory of the immortal chain for example<end>
<start>brothers what<end>
<start>he can influence people<end>
<start>i think it is julus when sunny comes out of the ro<end>
<start>thank you gray<end>
<start>cassie does not know technically it is not sure it is that<end>
<start>so jsp in real<end>
<start>c when already because i do not use the info of the last chap<end>
<start>i get it<end>
<start>precisely jy thought she said what the rain felt more and more like a ladder for even the advance of her soul c as her that i see it and as her soul strengthens the rain becomes more and more violent until it becomes a thunderstorm in the light that does not stop i see well the core of the groove ends to be created on the next chapter and genre that a lightning falls on the tyrant although we know that awakening does not necessarily mean appearance so may be that she would just have a physical reinforcement at the beginning and that the discovery of its appearance will take place later but it will have an aspect in relation to light water<end>
<start>volume<end>
<start>she will still enjoy you<end>
<start>and come back to ss when it is going well<end>
<start>holy is transcendent while i believe that nightmare is still ascending<end>
<start>i have this feeling of rush on the end that i do not like at all you see he could have done like a twilight making several pov his would have been well<end>
<start>ok nickel<end>
<start>sunny in pls at the end mdr<end>
<start>so we would have seen him<end>
<start>in the chap he is doing a little typing error there is written pwight instead of maybe i guess<end>
<start>it makes a bg strong in the super nice fight able to follow his plan and can give him a memory<end>
<start>nothing to see i know<end>
<start>yes<end>
<start>there is that king of thepees and that<end>
<start>to pass the labyrinth he uses a technique he has crafted to defeat bitret even if he is not on effective<end>
<start>the line rather you say those<end>
<start>they are going to be late<end>
<start>like it stores in case he is got the trigger<end>
<start>and it is really too important to tell<end>
<start>unless g wants to make sunny think that he can have a chance against the bird thief but it will hurt me<end>
<start>nephis who reveals his real goal has sunny to the shore forgets<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewcest-not-sorcerer-jamy-gourmaud-caa-fait-rcaflcachir-rcaflcachir-not-con-gif-<end>
<start>sorry to handle things at the same time '<end>
<start>but he no longer has access to his sea dcp<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>even though it is bitret frero seen the face of a third nightmare that sunny said was probably just a little harder than average the same her must be a hell<end>
<start>more than she could have any support from the big clan to get a cohort of news or something<end>
<start>if she does not make the connection i am going to have to change my judgment on her i am sorry<end>
<start>or she will never be infected with the spell<end>
<start>bvn in the club<end>
<start>to destroy it it can not just file a fielon or improve it with<end>
<start>he is going to make sure song wins<end>
<start>thank you the chaps for gray<end>
<start>frankly this is so stressful<end>
<start>nan pipou imp-chan should have typed a hook<end>
<start>well she would be interested in saying nothing<end>
<start>may not be<end>
<start>but when it activates it has anemone i understood<end>
<start>they are even among the strongest saints of lhumanite<end>
<start>ariel tomb<end>
<start>they put my knife under my throat to bring me up to date and live the end of the nightmare<end>
<start>but he is a part of the god forgets<end>
<start>in the same but related to the work you caster<end>
<start>it will not be in a very long time i think it is been a week since i said it shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>after as a cassie realized that she had forgotten i think nephis the little as well except that neph did not have all the information as a cassie and i do not think she would push her reflection so far<end>
<start>it is just really too hilarious shibalaugh<end>
<start>but what is the bottom of it also a knowledge so cruel that it would drive crazy or transform everything<end>
<start>his go-go-moo to mdr<end>
<start>i understand better how you imagined it ahah<end>
<start>thank you boss<end>
<start>goatesque moment<end>
<start>and the house of the night they have in sovereign dcp<end>
<start>yeah excuse me i was not throwing on<end>
<start>but i would not name it<end>
<start>no need to learn how to create her core lady etc he does it to you<end>
<start>he was already talking about it yesterday<end>
<start>after you say that but maybe she also saw what would happen if he did not<end>
<start>says<end>
<start>we must not forget that asterion is interested bcp to the god may be he knows and will do something<end>
<start>the mad prince yes<end>
<start>while it is just going to end has to do x<end>
<start>or i misunderstood it<end>
<start>so there is no vrmt relationship with kai<end>
<start>in the real world and cohort<end>
<start>ah bah nan of the blow xd<end>
<start>we do not do that anymore<end>
<start>ah bro really broke this carry she offers us it is just amazing<end>

<start>it says shibalaugh<end>
<start>he just does not have a destiny he writes it<end>
<start>that is exactly what happens to me when theories in my head finally contradict each other after<end>
<start>good bah rain wakes up<end>
<start>i learned these chapters and the way do not sunny lost was classy i find<end>
<start>ariel is the deamon of terror one of the deamon<end>
<start>it is sealed in the eternal vacuum<end>
<start>i had loved the volume i had simply been decyou by the end that i found much too simple and without stake in my opinion more at a point of the story or g puts a very big turn i find that it has diminished all the impact of the loss of the sunny sortlege by its winding in the heart of the estuary by all the events when it came into antarctic only week of time skip no loss of the continent valor a carrier the defense while they were not the sunny loses its exitlege in a random way a poor piaf who comes to eat a wire and hop not proof of action on his part to him on the influence of ca for example he who by the weaving gradually makes his destiny he crashes all the frame collapse and loses the exitlege qqch like ca mmh for example the corpse in the vault it was a daemon but nothing on him every bit of it that by the weaving gradually makes his destiny it crashes all the frame collapse and loses the exit qqch like ca mmh for example it was a daemon but it was nothing about him that i was trying to get rid of it before i tried to study it was a bad news that it was<end>
<start>that means he is more organic than holy<end>
<start>i say the next one<end>
<start>he is self proclaiming like this<end>
<start>mordret is equal with her at least<end>
<start>then the no idea<end>
<start>you do not think that master sunless would be sent to the forehead like a knight even fake<end>
<start>he never managed to find the estuary's cyou are<end>
<start>if she ends up on a happy ending it is because the god forgets is over<end>
<start>and that in his domain he is shadowed not merely his and his shadows has him but like any shadow in his domain is he<end>
<start>not necessarily it is said that eurys was looking for the shadow kingdom to die in peace i believe<end>
<start>worse stuff romance<end>
<start>the warning of the mad prince and the future sunny<end>
<start>when he had just left no<end>
<start>the brilliant emporium is the kebab of momo henni<end>
<start>paimontronk<end>
<start>i always put the name of the memory in suspense i did not have enough explanations but now the volume finished i finally have my answer<end>
<start>was a nameless banger<end>
<start>he tried to kill neph<end>
<start>for x or y reason<end>
<start>the appearance of gray<end>
<start>cassia is her first name cassia it is her 'snick' g rarely uses cassia most of the time it uses it when talking with people other than her parentscohortguards of fire<end>
<start>i am almost sure he is bound to the god of the cyou are<end>
<start>i break up perso<end>
<start>i want noctis<end>
<start>sunny has a big advantage over neph her face<end>
<start>during these last nightmares it falls every time in the fleet<end>
<start>you do not wake chuck norris or he makes you sleep for eternity<end>
<start>jsp if he really thinks so then he can say it<end>
<start>but it is placed at the same level as nephis and then bites why not<end>
<start>even if i think more than he wants to keep him locked up<end>
<start>yeah you know i always wonder what i am going to do when i get to the end<end>
<start>but like her could bring back some memory<end>
<start>it uses the skull of a vacuum<end>
<start>i thought you were talking about neph<end>
<start>old fool<end>
<start>at least it is moving forward<end>
<start>they are too strong<end>
<start>finally the sovereigns in action<end>
<start>his may have been a shadow mdr<end>
<start>the old horse remains the best solution then<end>
<start>like the first longest nightmare<end>
<start>in vf<end>
<start>but it is going to be a whole new person<end>
<start>it depends on the type of domain i think mostly not<end>
<start>the most deadly nest<end>
<start>he is kind of losing a clone or something<end>
<start>naaaan it is too cruel the two chapsj catscream catscream i want to know rainuuus<end>
<start>or else we can put all the work's info back on top of this strove is troll<end>
<start>at least<end>
<start>that is too much the guy who read the chaps you is a shibalaugh crazy<end>
<start>you said he did not lose it<end>
<start>or i am confused<end>
<start>and mwa i was bringing we are going to avoid spoil<end>
<start>do not abuse<end>
<start>sunny times more beautiful than her<end>
<start>he has a way of giving snake c serious<end>
<start>- kai<end>
<start>guys i have been thinking about something if sunny wanted to increase his core from the shadow pq he did not spam the monsters for the increase before the nightmare knowing that after killing monsters wake up or fallen will bring him fewer fragments<end>
<start>what is going on with the emiliahappy<end>
<start>i do not think shadow mentions here is the shadow gods i think it is really just a shadow like the one at your feet it would be weird to have pieces of nobody and after a god<end>
<start>there would need or sunny to beat someone up<end>
<start>not to know<end>
<start>time to answer the question<end>
<start>it is crazy<end>
<start>it is not bad too<end>
<start>power to the sovereign<end>
<start>thank you gray for the chaps<end>
<start>for me the only way the fragment remains is that it is bound to the citadel<end>
<start>i think that sunny is stronger from above the weakest<end>
<start>pepehehehehehehe<end>
<start>i forgot that<end>
<start>i would say impure beast<end>
<start>reading something like that any wake becomes an elite shibalaugh<end>
<start>okay i did not understand because i am having a friend read<end>
<start>after effie it is not the beginning either<end>
<start>i like the vibe of<end>
<start>otherwise there will be conflict between the two<end>
<start>honestly it would surprise me that the volume makes more chapter<end>
<start>i have a site since - month that just publishes with one day late is already not bad<end>
<start>he died<end>

<start>alea<end>
<start>but it was really scary<end>
<start>i am so untrustworthy<end>
<start>i keep my odds theory when mm<end>
<start>lose the master slave relationship but keep the link boost<end>
<start>that i would say<end>
<start>and like her larva would have gone up to the rank of superior asterion would have been no more sacred<end>
<start>in skizo mode it was serious funny<end>
<start>and i would really like it<end>
<start>avatars he daeron ptet corpses of superior monsters<end>
<start>when you see that the equivalent monster is a thousand crazy paws<end>
<start>and the capacities of a lazy<end>
<start>that allows one to exist in the other and that they benefit one another yes<end>
<start>but in real cassia c possible also because we could see that she was afraid when she offered the choice to sunny<end>
<start>we know each other<end>
<start>effie who kept making jokes about the fact that master sunless was better than the lord of shabalaugh shadows<end>
<start>crazy to see how powerful sunny has become to the point of killing skin carrier with a single shadow knowing alone can kill or hurt a saint transform<end>
<start>acquire mastery of gasoline<end>
<start>but if not what do you think of my theory as what asterion would have encompassed the whole tune with its domain<end>
<start>really it was incredibly well written their exchange<end>
<start>impure titan<end>
<start>in true yes<end>
<start>the fact that the lord of shadows represents half of the power of sunny makes it think that at some point he will make a second two avatars with each - shadows<end>
<start>on the other hand i wonder if any sunny is a variable in these visions<end>
<start>so this<end>
<start>curious to see what he will undertake but knowing the style of the author i guess we will have a whole volume devoted to a solo adventure of sunny before we find the cohort for sure the arch of the pyramid<end>
<start>i find it better to put the negations<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewtrinity-trinita-trinitca-gif-<end>
<start>but even if he is even a saint and ananke has explained to him the basics how he knows how a classical human becomes awakened because he knows the theory at last almost but often the practice remains different<end>
<start>if we have no idea of the asterion localization maybe he went on the moon to protect the lunar colonies and make it his asterion domain it is a little spatial name i find asteroides astre<end>
<start>for now it is also my favorite bow<end>
<start>jthinks that he is also a bearer of divine aspect<end>
<start>real<end>
<start>oh well seen also i like this idea<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>why not wash while you are there<end>
<start>not after her nightmare<end>
<start>so it is a swarm of superior beasts i think at the limit of fleaux<end>
<start>jsp is where it seems<end>
<start>and i guess he cannot get into nightmare seeds anymore<end>
<start>how you destroy a saint when you are in v<end>
<start>if i do not have anything to add i will have the draft on my pc<end>
<start>i was talking about the chap of course<end>
<start>in view of the locations outside the blood weaving it was not going to fall on anyone<end>
<start>but dcp you think she wakes next chapter<end>
<start>i have never been taken as much as in the current chapters<end>
<start>thank you<end>
<start>i am like a missing drug i scratch my veins while waiting for the chaps -<end>
<start>perso cest may be my same or third volume pref<end>
<start>but as sunny has the mask<end>
<start>we are broken<end>
<start>the more he has the more powerful he is<end>
<start>it is easy to say that i do not think g will justify itself with these arguments<end>
<start>and nephis glazing so sunny<end>
<start>chap when sunny and neph are on the black turtle the fish of comfort we spoil already mdr<end>
<start>he must not have any permission at home<end>
<start>g bastard goes<end>
<start>and since nether is bound to nothing<end>
<start>if sunny master had killed a corrupt titan we would be a little lost<end>
<start>more biome remains<end>
<start>that says if there is a person who does not want to get in a relationship with sunny even before the oblivion it is really cassie<end>
<start>every ruler would have a great line<end>
<start>you talk about goliath or the winter beast<end>
<start>please<end>
<start>the return of batman his scary talk not he often observes us in shadow<end>
<start>a part nephis jet et mordret<end>
<start>i do not see what a merchant would do to a serious god even if he is friends with the fireguards<end>
<start>he is handling them well<end>
<start>yeah but dcp he cannot turn his shadows into crazy creatures<end>
<start>when i said fate it is the english word<end>
<start>he does it sovereign see more so i guess it is more complicated than that<end>
<start>when i say let jvould say lose like weaver but expres for example<end>
<start>sunny said he had to see nephis fight in real situation<end>
<start>she always has to try to stand out from others<end>
<start>bastion is a titan superior i think<end>
<start>the she has to please herself<end>
<start>it was true that there were gods<end>
<start>because we have to count the evolution of sunny in lvl of witchcraft and the fact that everyone has become corrupted in a natural way<end>
<start>good kids we stop it a bit ya batman that is not far away<end>
<start>good courage for utilite<end>
<start>the light of the godgrave sun<end>
<start>the real result of the fight<end>
<start>must be left in ignorance<end>
<start>hmm okay and how they made the connection to ariel that is the dread daemon if i do not say betise<end>
<start>with a small message from g in bonus<end>
<start>incredible nickname i will keep it in head shibalaugh<end>
<start>desolate of not being able to participate in the debate<end>
<start>omniscient reader<end>
<start>but if they come out late in the future<end>
<start>remain branch<end>
<start>you are deep down<end>
<start>she cannot take a bridge<end>
<start>jsplut what difference but fates that leave a line<end>
<start>i think he will go explore the snow zone<end>
<start>unless he changes his mind<end>
<start>and that the release is the way he has found to try to save as many people as possible from the influence of his corrupt father<end>
<start>personally i do not know why but i would say that he wants to re-veil the gods in the bearers of the exit leg in order to bring them back to life their line would be a way for them to resurrect and the exit lege to forge ships able to welcome them and then stop the god forgets it sounds crazy and wonder why i have this theory but it is the<end>
<start>admits he gere<end>
<start>about<end>
<start>in a question answer g confirmed that the name gives the cassy baton that is the name of the bird<end>
<start>sybille or something but in my mind i imagine it as a sirene<end>
<start>she gave him the choice and warned her of the consequences her sunny who made herself choose and cassie returned it to him i her steps that it is necessary as proof of her forgiveness<end>
<start>there are many priests you talk about great priests but there are less important ones like ananke<end>
<start>it is normal not to love your family too much in this case the shibalaugh<end>
<start>especially kai<end>
<start>there would be nothing funny if it happened to such extremes now as said above before it was generally the prevention first of all<end>
<start>but it does not prevent cassie from remaining more dangerous<end>
<start>death of noctis and ananke or revelation on the<end>
<start>but we will see well but a priori it indicates not being a memory just after so its really let us me think he is a saint<end>
<start>oa you are so big that even your auto-corrector gets into it<end>
<start>the volume finished towards the chapter how much<end>
<start>her ability is to be able to cut things as if she is an epee and her default is what is not able to turn her capacity on<end>
<start>rohhhhh<end>
<start>my quentin guy who is still wearing missing catscreen<end>
<start>olep 'lie' but i am talking about the evolutive side snake rises in power with sunny the weapon will rise in power with the nephis ame which comes back a little to the same off the echo but a function of modulation of form if it is with its soul that it manifests itself it is possible<end>
<start>i will never understand the point of doing this frankly<end>
<start>even potential saints<end>
<start>training in its field<end>
<start>yep<end>
<start>masterclass your hot hot<end>
<start>that would be useless then<end>
<start>it was confirmed by g otherwise<end>
<start>jsuis a lepisode but what mas the most makes kiffer is the development of groove ptn the goat that it will be<end>
<start>black sea<end>
<start>yeah it was not my biggest kiff but we felt it was a transition arc<end>
<start>jveux too kai dies and it starts to accuse sunny and since bro is an idol worldtier the whole world hates sunny who will be forced to exile and farm like a degenere<end>
<start>it is above<end>
<start>so i think the avatar that follows rain<end>
<start>yeah right<end>
<start>if you are talking about the shadow dance i think i do<end>
<start>it was on the moon that we discovered the first but at any time yen is just another one we had not seen<end>
<start>oh i did not care i got skip or mdr<end>
<start>effie who wrestles with titans<end>
<start>she is going to be too big she is going to see sunless in pk mode<end>
<start>it is good to see them having such a light talk<end>
<start>but it is not really a dheritier clan and what i understand the cult if we can call it as it does not come out was not very powerful<end>
<start>so she is a fan of no one now<end>
<start>he is like that<end>
<start>it is been a long time since i understood the name of a ss chap<end>
<start>small debate has its bounty as master sunny en v could vrm sink without too much difficulty transcendent creation below tyranny now that sunny is a saint you think it is the same with superior creation genre that v classic it destructs daeron corrupt form<end>
<start>see<end>
<start>he is kind of wiped it out of fate in real life<end>
<start>if he can make spawn a rain depee like his outside of his estate it would be too cheap nan<end>
<start>bah kai has no heart line<end>
<start>he saw neither of them again and then an unclean titan it almost has the power of a deamon<end>
<start>jespere it will be well planned but with even body to body as g is well written<end>
<start>stv<end>
<start>i am so curious about what is going to happen from now on like how they are going to bond up is what it is going to remember is that its destiny to it is still tied to it even if it has more etc i am too much waiting<end>
<start>and it is a first nan<end>
<start>magic power of the scenario divine aspect of g it will succeed if it has to happen<end>
<start>too hurry to see the chaps<end>
<start>she did her time the lady<end>
<start>versatile sacrament our dear sunny<end>
<start>i think people do not forget what sunny taught them but they forget about his life etc so that is why rain did not forget his lecon but that cassie forgot the information about sunny's parents<end>
<start>i think if<end>
<start>so weaver does not have much to touch his goals<end>
<start>i will only kill you a little bit<end>
<start>just biting scared<end>
<start>neither do i<end>
<start>i know that<end>
<start>like in the future one could even another world being infected at the same time<end>
<start>that is so much i wanted to see as a message that<end>
<start>but if not it seems very hard<end>
<start>at last<end>
<start>even if the rank differences are exponential<end>
<start>it will be logical i am going to<end>
<start>like he is not against but not anymore with the protagonists<end>
<start>i am chap if you want to know a little bit like that you know or you are standing for not spoil ahah<end>
<start>you also want to pray cassia x<end>
<start>i have a question i am at the beginning of the flight but i cannot imagine where the other suns are<end>
<start>what a fine conclusion finally<end>
<start>but it would not be her kind of doing that shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>i am calling the future mdr's sunny<end>
<start>in any case curious to see where his next mission will lead him and the ship on groove that becomes legal mtn shibalagh<end>
<start>i missed an element that gave theories<end>
<start>ah yes it invalidates a little theory i think<end>
<start>chapter exactly how<end>
<start>the real name<end>
<start>seeds are in the rdr so no problem<end>
<start>even dragon has me mp on his yesterday shibalaugh<end>
<start>anyway one thing that is sure is that she did not just see with her powers that it was the guy's birthday in front of her there is definitely something more than her smile weakens a little proves it<end>
<start>then the oracles of the great clans will no longer have any means of knowing that there exists and cassie neither<end>
<start>tfacon the plan is simple wait to the maximum of my abilities then resume everything and smooth my reading speed to arrive to day towards the end of the work<end>
<start>we are not if he wants to get rid of the bond or the bond and the attribute<end>
<start>not wow<end>
<start>volume<end>
<start>i did not think about it<end>
<start>and that he could copy any person in his domain<end>
<start>i do not know if i have to believe it<end>
<start>the god of the war of the life of progress technology and craft and lintellect<end>
<start>i did not know why you did not like flying<end>
<start>about what time<end>
<start>she already has a very good impression of the lord of shadows<end>
<start>oripawnkill<end>
<start>and i must watch avatar for love too<end>
<start>i told him he is not listening<end>
<start>but she does not steal the shit<end>
<start>even so i am not convinced<end>
<start>and the romance we have been waiting for a long time<end>
<start>we do not know but i was saying that the date probably made him look like a legend<end>
<start>ahhhhhh ok yvois<end>
<start>tonight chaps i make them in min<end>
<start>weaving to improve it is probably shadow and spin the shop<end>
<start>i swear they do too much taff<end>
<start>but outside the nuke of nephis no one can do anything against this guy sovereigns do not count<end>
<start>are criminal<end>
<start>pog<end>
<start>you have been doing all the convs since you started the work<end>
<start>when he says no do not go<end>
<start>it uses the lantern to remove all reflections<end>
<start>thank you yarg<end>
<start>yeah but she does not know that anymore<end>
<start>chained island became the kingdom of dreams<end>
<start>or he will be able to create his own sortelege because for the moment one of his steps still brings to him the fabric of soul in his witchcraft because the previous inheritance of weaver one helps in any way in his witchcraft<end>
<start>but as a saint the fallen works more<end>
<start>that is not bad<end>
<start>i do not like linfo<end>
<start>the greek mythology version of sirene or it is semi-human birds with beautiful voices that uses them to deceive men<end>
<start>anyway i am going to go to bed good night<end>
<start>yes i forgot the wake<end>
<start>oh i forgot that was when<end>
<start>sunny and shadow having a secret affair<end>
<start>last time i did not read day i thought i was going to cry<end>
<start>i am not convinced of that<end>
<start>i think it is more likely to go back to the tomb than to fight the sovereigns without knowing their fault<end>
<start>thanks to the goat<end>
<start>i really started<end>
<start>laughs laughs laughs<end>
<start>and i know the rest will be better<end>
<start>may be on the moon<end>
<start>why compare when you can enjoy these monsters<end>
<start>otherwise the others would have taken the place of their future version too<end>
<start>he must have given up to the skin walker<end>
<start>bah you read the last chaps<end>
<start>just imagine like he can weave sons of destiny for people just like nephis can implement his flame of desire<end>
<start>he is a lot late man<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>anyway the description of the enchantment is that he<end>
<start>woah thanks for chaps<end>
<start>i confess the spectator or he will spend his time even i do not believe too much<end>
<start>weaver who pays a lady eclat to stay in the castle<end>
<start>he has already read '<end>
<start>it is not a heritage the she will<end>
<start>psq in view of the passage with future sunny i have the impression that the domain and the authority are two different things<end>
<start>nan in real life it is a good reflection seen the passive but personal i really do not think<end>
<start>it can become a fucking farm a xp<end>
<start>on the other hand tamar who is chokbar his kills me<end>
<start>but a sovereign probably has a resistance to this kind of thing and doubts its existence<end>
<start>sunny vs nephis<end>
<start>i know but it is frustrating when it is even<end>
<start>or so it is not completely on<end>
<start>but then we do not know more about the son effie whether he is a saint or not<end>
<start>i guess there is a reason to hide but i admit it does not make sense<end>
<start>god bete or deesse of the moon of the hunting of the fleshly desire of the blood of the beauty and the cycle of birth and death god of hunters<end>
<start>yeah i do not click on spoilers<end>
<start>in big part i had hate to see the rewards<end>
<start>it is a bebe overheat or just cheese<end>
<start>or else it is just the shadows but it is a little simplistic<end>
<start>the work is so amazing there is only the best moments ahah<end>
<start>even by killing her she does not die<end>
<start>but he still betrayed the cohort<end>
<start>i hate to see what the sunny domain looks like too<end>
<start>there was chuck norris<end>
<start>i thought about it too<end>
<start>comparison with other<end>
<start>and make the stones talk<end>
<start>on him<end>
<start>it can anticipate the future<end>
<start>yeah nan sah<end>
<start>ok bv pck ya way to scratch a kill for them with wtp or i know more ct how exactly<end>
<start>it does not say he comes from a clan that had beliefs about it<end>
<start>it works like kernel row of sunny<end>
<start>cassie is the akinator of the group so good<end>
<start>incredible<end>
<start>a new cassie debate hutaowoke<end>
<start>yeah name description and rank cnes all<end>
<start>she must have waited until she got here and she is efficacious<end>
<start>good a when live trad ss<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewkimono-palmashow-gif-<end>
<start>i am getting a little dizzy but yes a little bit in that idea<end>
<start>a great memory flair<end>
<start>in fact i think that what bothers me especially is that in english the sentence is the same if we speak of nothing or of a concept names nothing while in french the sentence is different<end>
<start>there is too many possibilities he is become so cheap it is crazy<end>
<start>morgan's marriage proposal<end>
<start>very real<end>
<start>i hesitated between sunny and throwing at the end<end>
<start>and this is the best solution for this<end>
<start>with words<end>
<start>the shadows did not activate automatically so he did not have that problem<end>
<start>by itself is what sunny really needs to make a big gun with snake that is evolutive<end>
<start>seeing really is really about how it is going to be<end>
<start>for it is said that weaver is born of god but after you have theories he would have created them also so<end>
<start>we passed from the shadows recognize you as one of their shadows consider you one of their champions and then something in the shadow style recognizes you as their master<end>
<start>wait for you or o-jiji<end>
<start>like i said kai for me it is the least likely to die because it is the least dev of the cohort<end>
<start>you cannot be oblivated<end>
<start>biter who will start beating all the members of valor til crosses the street<end>
<start>nan but squarely the impure beast erupts the titan dormant shits on it<end>
<start>i love her<end>
<start>even a supreme begaye<end>
<start>the mask hides the fate of the person nan genre makes him invisible to the premonition<end>
<start>oh nan<end>
<start>so he told morgan that his only reason for living was his revenge<end>
<start>or it is sunny<end>
<start>it freaks out<end>
<start>but the ct qd mm very precise and it just fits too well to nephis and sunny mtn<end>
<start>she is like like bad-ass midas<end>
<start>especially that objectively and purely objectively we get along neph has always put him a short speed<end>
<start>i forgot i think<end>
<start>yeah sunny had no idea what she was talking about<end>
<start>even if i think i prefer the volume<end>
<start>i do not know if it changes for them to wake up but sleepers do not have access to enchantment and memory<end>
<start>aelmofire<end>
<start>if he takes a day break that is frankly ridiculous compares to his work alongside<end>
<start>so i think we will be in the last flash back so that she is right or what motivation made her come back to the level of humanity right i guess he does not want his friends to die but i feel that there is something else<end>
<start>in real life it is mostly that it seems slow to read j but in itself if you do all of a sudden you realize it is really fast<end>
<start>if i know the subject of the math baccalaureate in advance that i only review that and i have the max note that does not mean i am smart<end>
<start>i do not know how things work<end>
<start>sunny became so strong that ireel<end>
<start>overall anvil the given asterion against the help of this one for something and when bite came back everyone trusted him and they even tried to kill him because he was too powerful<end>
<start>it is a sunny theophage<end>
<start>i will reassure you he is gallere for the trade and it is temporary<end>
<start>as the bit says it is just recluses<end>
<start>if there is still<end>
<start>we were fucking right<end>
<start>the cursed sovereign<end>
<start>she is going to hit with all her strength it is going to make a little poop<end>
<start>actually we do not know it is possible but not confirmed<end>
<start>especially that this not in asterion mode did service against a debt and then tipped by saying in exchange of your debt file your anvil kid was aware at the beginning<end>
<start>probably after i think that sunny well prepare will be better than nephis in her ability to terrace her where i think nephis will be better in situations the preparation is impossible<end>
<start>i am going to go see that pepemafia<end>
<start>because if not the number of civilians who would depopulate<end>
<start>so terrible that<end>
<start>he knows the face of shadow after trying to possess him<end>
<start>o but he cannot be on<end>
<start>the accomplishment of madness<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwormhole-pokemon-nihilego-ultra-beast-sun-and-moon-gif-<end>
<start>ninphis<end>
<start>he is done what sunny of all the ames crystals he is been looting for years in your opinion<end>
<start>she wanted to purify the world so her appearance the permit then to accentuate it her supremacy allowed her to spread her field of action<end>
<start>yes i go away<end>
<start>he wants to shoot us<end>
<start>ha nan i say of the betises the natural sleepers have no appearance<end>
<start>the quotation confirms that this is not the case<end>
<start>on the other hand we potentially lose the duo nephis sunny i do not like it<end>
<start>nightmare must leave with his hoofs<end>
<start>because the dream kingdom is an assemblage of the divine kingdom and not divine elsewhere<end>
<start>yeah i know it is for her<end>
<start>personally i was expecting something like this at some point<end>
<start>like gray it is the var it spawn kill spoilers<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbatman-gif-<end>
<start>or the author just wants to keep the surprise<end>
<start>nnnaaaannnn<end>
<start>from time to time<end>
<start>what a banker<end>
<start>in any case it is a shame to see how it is going to evolve<end>
<start>of memory<end>
<start>but you believed it<end>
<start>still<end>
<start>bonodad if it happens as i think we will compete with the effie church with the cassie church animepray<end>
<start>and all<end>
<start>the best to do to bring back his mp sound rather than put it here<end>
<start>oh ptn madness<end>
<start>i did not know yen had a<end>
<start>perfect timing gray thanks for chaps<end>
<start>so if the bond of shadow works more while it is tjr it is that there is no master or slave<end>
<start>not to forget the movie of the cohort on the shore forgets<end>
<start>shibalaugh it is good the post elipse bow is easy without my top of the best bow start<end>
<start>a nuke his share quickly mdr<end>
<start>but overall there is a little bit of everything<end>
<start>he is the stupid rival<end>
<start>we are going to take the time to dappreciate reading<end>
<start>mmh i do not know for me he may have lost memories enough that he modifies them and then they are tied to his soul<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewjust-wait-wait-for-it-be-patient-tom-hanks-gif-<end>
<start>unlike sunny or nephis<end>
<start>i think the world<end>
<start>precisely that is what he says he prefers to develop his personal power rather than create cheatee memories<end>
<start>moreover when i would resume ss i would repeat the chap<end>
<start>i speak in the nightmare<end>
<start>we talk a lot shibalaugh<end>
<start>less hard<end>
<start>we pray<end>
<start>i remember you said something like that in coms ahah<end>
<start>i did not understand what you meant<end>
<start>knight sunny may be accompanied by her princess<end>
<start>it is always nice to see effie<end>
<start>technically if the two can buffs have overpowering memories of experience and kai can practically one shot anyone apart sovereign and holy to the defensive aspect<end>
<start>thanks for chaps<end>
<start>because sunny he is hungry but not so much<end>
<start>i have never said that it is not hard to write i am doing it myself so yes i understand the difficulty of keeping a consistency predicting the story keeping a good level of writing it is nothing simple but it remains a work and as i wrote earlier in a classic day of h it really has nothing insurmountable and i think it does more a day especially if he predicted the thread of his story in advance the argument of the pages is not admissible because if we compare it to the other authors of webnovel i answer you that yes widely if we compare it to novelists and well not but it is not comparable the same for the days of conge he said that he did not take any w-e i will look at the fact that he always has chapters in advance as he showed by going off in vacs officially but in short it is not comparable the same for the days of conge he said that he did not take any w-e i will look at the fact that he always has chapters in advance as he showed by going off in vacs officially but in short i realize that he does not get away from the subject so i's going to have to keep on a discussion so<end>
<start>it was so obvious that i forgot to specify it<end>
<start>dwayneeyebrow<end>
<start>sunny worth too<end>
<start>o but it sucks<end>
<start>i have never heard of anything else<end>
<start>for i do not know what groove<end>
<start>but then the groove can have the exit or not<end>
<start>hahaha we are really together my guy i gave up the house to go on<end>
<start>it is too elaborate for a lie<end>
<start>wait for me to tell<end>
<start>she would not wake up again when he gets it<end>
<start>or that it radically changes his relationship with nephis in a wrong direction<end>
<start>aah i think i have the ref<end>
<start>bah hope may not be dead as we see her escaping into the same nightmares<end>
<start>with the doubts that sunny ever would have agreed to blindly follow the orders of cassia<end>
<start>something is tough<end>
<start>she has a husband when she is still<end>
<start>hmm okay i had not made the link or i did not necessarily pay attention to details but thank you anyway<end>
<start>never efficates her dose likes too much<end>
<start>what well<end>
<start>nephis supremacy<end>
<start>you want me to drop the thing with prince of valor writing<end>
<start>so it starts<end>
<start>me when i reincarnate myself in a demon of shadow with arms<end>
<start>and he can still receive the recompensations of aspect<end>
<start>after i had seen a theorie ya doors of categories that opened just before the transcendence of neph sunny and biter and another that opened in south america just about at the moment where asterion is holy pass<end>
<start>finally a chapter has the beach so i can affirm that this arc is one of the best arc slice of life of fiction<end>
<start>north quadrant siege capital<end>
<start>we will see in any way<end>
<start>thank you my goat<end>
<start>that is g that says it<end>
<start>the transformation of sunny as a transcendent you love i do not know yet ahah<end>
<start>we are going to ask for a braille trade in tribute<end>
<start>this is the player option on safari and google<end>
<start>just yesterday i already did it once<end>
<start>hot or cold water<end>
<start>quentin was awakened while nephis no<end>
<start>and in real life for the volume i do not think we have a crazy development with information about the godsdeamons etc less than asterion sen mel in the middle of the war but i would see more the volume as just the songvalor war and the passage of sunny and nephis as sovereign and history with asterion for the volumes dapres<end>
<start>trust in g so he does not betray<end>
<start>and how he will return to the world of revs since he is more co nct at the exit lege<end>
<start>theoretically we saw him<end>
<start>a little saint<end>
<start>personal i would have waited for midnight shibalaugh<end>
<start>but good as sovereigns it would seem pressure too easy meh<end>
<start>jai hate to see is worth theorie for the end of hehe volume<end>
<start>and besides he cannot make his shadows grow like this<end>
<start>in francais you cannot just remove the negation as you propose it would be more correct to put the nothing and all the reflections that sunny would make would serve nothing because the concept would be explicit<end>
<start>mouahahaha<end>
<start>oh it is not the shadow god who created death a long time ago<end>
<start>do i wait for every whole volume or read every day<end>
<start>that is who says ananke<end>
<start>it was with fingers to dive into a superior titan<end>
<start>so i do not know the edt of g but based on the chaps that come out a day bah it is not the sea to drink away from me to denigrate his work but should not consider either that it is a monstrous taff in a classic day of h unless he has a job like yes respect<end>
<start>after that i know more if they go back to the tomb as sovereign precisely because if i remember sunny describe the other sunny as unfathomable when he had already contributed a lot of saint<end>
<start>like i just picked up<end>
<start>you know i think cassie's going to die too<end>
<start>i have a sacred memory<end>
<start>they took what a year on the last<end>
<start>so transcendent yes<end>
<start>it is too dangerous for the sovereigns<end>
<start>it must be really boring<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmaybe-i-do not-know-no-idea-do not-know-i-do not-know-gif-<end>
<start>even the seer did not see it coming<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewups-error-facepalm-gif-<end>
<start>yes i am hurting her and if only there was that her i imagine your not yet finishing the volume<end>
<start>i also hope but seeing that she does not go through the exit leg she will have the strength of a wake but without her appearance she also has to wake her up later i think she has to do it at the same time that she accepts her default of the monks that ananke had said remains to see how her will roll<end>
<start>we do not know if that is his real name or not<end>
<start>the transformation of that song it must be a ver deguelasse<end>
<start>pardon gray<end>
<start>there is the chaps in english if you really want to advance shibalaugh<end>
<start>she would have been able to<end>
<start>it is line on pc<end>
<start>no more<end>
<start>or i will give you the chains<end>
<start>that makes me maaal<end>
<start>impossible nephis is fmc<end>
<start>a real saying it is been a long time since the author spoke again about the dance of shadow<end>
<start>on the last v the fish of comfort was incredible<end>
<start>tossed out of laughter<end>
<start>personal i forgave cassie<end>
<start>and it disturbs the anchors for a wake falling asleep in front of a seed comes back to be done in the rdr beside the said seed<end>
<start>if the future exists in the nightmare it is because it is temporally existing in the tomb before sunny and nephis arrive in it<end>
<start>above all you reassure me<end>
<start>we readers present in this show do not like new readers who ask to be spoiled<end>
<start>logik<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmy-pleasure-mad-men-no-problem-gif-<end>
<start>he did not lose the lantern so weird he lost it<end>
<start>i cannot imagine him becoming a beast like the usual saints<end>
<start>we can kneel for a lot of reason<end>
<start>technically they say that weaver's line has eaten that of the shadow but with this story of weaving the shadow arrgghhh<end>
<start>it was a madness<end>
<start>for now all that is setup is a little bit of seeing<end>
<start>a year is the time they put back to cassie<end>
<start>there is plenty to sleep xd<end>
<start>emoji<end>
<start>a but vrm these chaps is a madness how inside his hurt<end>
<start>it is the same for effie and kai i think<end>
<start>cassie had just got it is power she did not understand them anymore seeing sunny assassin someone could see him attacking his best friend<end>
<start>we can say anything we want and all the insults of the world on cassia but she is always there to say happy birthday to her<end>
<start>how you get out<end>
<start>in real life we are going to the or even with a groove his but i wonder how we create a defect but especially his surprise would not surprise me that to anchor his domain this term comes back very often sah it would need a real name<end>
<start>as long as it is just theories even if she is sure she can remember but she asks confirmation to sunny she will forget her answer as the first time<end>
<start>to break fate he cannot just say i want to break fate in front of the fountain<end>
<start>it does not have a big enough revelation to change pov on the<end>
<start>you think sunny's going to do what<end>
<start>and his means what we are late chap<end>
<start>not completely<end>
<start>yeah i forgot that part of his abilities<end>
<start>if there is any who want<end>
<start>then if the chair is destroyed and the comma will mourn on and yet c an object<end>
<start>but the tomb of ariel was so much a peak fiction<end>
<start>yeah but not too much otherwise it spoils the fun of the crazy situations they have<end>
<start>a little real<end>
<start>i like him but if he cannot fight normally with civilians it is rejuvenated<end>
<start>incrr me personally i will believe it<end>
<start>haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<end>
<start>there is a moment when he explains that it takes the sovereign's agreement to make his nightmare<end>
<start>as if she already knew the nightmare since the beginning<end>
<start>from what i understood when i reread it is some kind of dead baby wrapping in a shroud that looks like a flower from afar<end>
<start>the antarctic is the one i least like to read except the end<end>
<start>as long as her core is safe she stays alive<end>
<start>she is not dev yet especially it is the xdd<end>
<start>titan sleeping and impure beast especially<end>
<start>so for you it does not complete it is just two guys that look a lot alike<end>
<start>just have to do a heap with magic sand grains in his body<end>
<start>our love of learning to read english prevails over having chapters in advance<end>
<start>in case<end>
<start>ha ok<end>
<start>real question guys<end>
<start>dcp the well of wishes is just a legend<end>
<start>my hand theory is that it will modif<end>
<start>the chapter is chill<end>
<start>they will try to threaten nephis<end>
<start>i am sure cassie's banging monumental bars in front of what created<end>
<start>so that he may be free from destiny and what he can use to change it<end>
<start>and if the domain of the sunny once supreme<end>
<start>that is our big deal<end>
<start>sunny thanks to weaving and other thanks to their capacity or attributes<end>
<start>pray that snake did not die in the performance of his duties cbpray<end>
<start>unfortunately<end>
<start>crazy<end>
<start>yeah sean he is the master he is met up with he is dead like that<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthanks-gif-<end>
<start>if kai has the same transfo saint that the lord of terror i will have a valid theory<end>
<start>i think if dcp<end>
<start>yep here<end>
<start>ahlala<end>
<start>yep<end>
<start>knowing that the daemons are almost at the lvl of the gods nn<end>
<start>attention to you<end>
<start>like everyone else<end>
<start>we are not sure but the theory as much as possible that he kills a thief bird to get the exit leg<end>
<start>not to take the nightmare<end>
<start>the symbol of the sun is lion or eagle or phenix so it is between them i think<end>
<start>head of the cassy fc<end>
<start>thank you captain obvious<end>
<start>you got tryhard xd<end>
<start>as long as we wait for the end of the volume<end>
<start>for me too<end>
<start>i see that<end>
<start>you did not click on the current one maybe for that<end>
<start>kai he had no power up or sherritage of appearance<end>
<start>i am hungry the dung<end>
<start>sunny explored god serious for the year and he lives in a black dome that contrasts strongly with the landscape<end>
<start>thank you old cat<end>
<start>i do not know what to do<end>
<start>antarctica<end>
<start>stopping<end>
<start>nan he was not there if he is the one who says he is theorizing it when they are on the boat on their way to the antarctic<end>
<start>anyway i already said weaver is a sdf<end>
<start>you know the first of april has passed<end>
<start>it is not bad too but he can just observe a gloomy rye and that transfo into her mdrr<end>
<start>it depends on shibalaugh<end>
<start>the titan goliath<end>
<start>but you will see why something other than a one-week skip time would have been such a mess<end>
<start>twine<end>
<start>you see in those moments i am jealous of my children<end>
<start>it is no refusal but it does not particularly affect me personally<end>
<start>i am too excited about the nightmare aprees<end>
<start>i would say you are going to do it again now as we are at the beginning of the volume or you are waiting for the end of the volume but it might be in - months<end>
<start>she guesses it thanks to memory<end>
<start>you did not have to come here<end>
<start>mini theory i think that asterion is the only divine suverrain each of the other sovereign would have found people with precisely lines to be able to compete with it we know that it is the sovereign who makes the most fear a nephis and who according to sunny must be the strongest because the most mysterious so i think that he has a divine line and is looking for another divine carrier for a great mission<end>
<start>i cannot find the extract<end>
<start>yeah but the fact that it is acting at the same time that the sovereigns move after anvil does not seem to do anything in particular that might suggest he is going to act<end>
<start>the sourren will try to reach a black pyramid that would be the dariel tomb but i wondered dou is what sunny cass etc know the existence of this place cest written that they saw in the nd nightmare or qqch like that but i did not remember that in the realm of hop and at what moment sunny discovers that if qqn would well enlighten my lantern would be nice this long sorry<end>
<start>i am a mask<end>
<start>you assume that<end>
<start>i too but i reflect on possibilities<end>
<start>and not its appearance<end>
<start>especially with shit-frills like biting it really will not last long jpense<end>
<start>jsp if clear<end>
<start>one sees it sunny has access to a part of the domain of the god of shadow that is not his yet it is not supreme<end>
<start>who is stupid enough to want to wake up without the exit<end>
<start>maybe one with a line that can manipulate the heart the soul and emotions but i do not see who<end>
<start>his shadows in transformation also have weavings not so his shadows will be strong that sunny himself<end>
<start>there was a question that was asked about whether the mad prince was more advanced than sunny in the dance of shadow g said yes<end>
<start>yeah that is good<end>
<start>so strong that snake<end>
<start>no it mainly lacks the fleau of all being living corruption in its purest state the hope made woman<end>
<start>a phoenix while its strong point is its fencing<end>
<start>thrill<end>
<start>ellipse really was a great decision<end>
<start>also hate<end>
<start>who could hold the dream god and his corruption once and for all<end>
<start>same bitter that will become a real threat for anvil jai hate to see both meet<end>
<start>i wanted to hold on to chap<end>
<start>i confess that funny shibalaugh<end>
<start>in the cafe when there julius beth the irregular effie<end>
<start>i even remembered more of that information-- laughs her<end>
<start>bah v mordret loses against sunny<end>
<start>i think we can say it without too much trouble<end>
<start>cbkannasip shibalaugh<end>
<start>fielon on his side who sees sunny kill him in ultrablackos loop<end>
<start>wait a minute<end>
<start>good well then there must have been a lot of cycle mdr<end>
<start>it is for a funny friend<end>
<start>put him in your screen he will see him tomorrow<end>
<start>rectification i did not overkick the<end>
<start>by the way i forgot how mordet learned his real name<end>
<start>it is on their first memorial visit<end>
<start>o i agree<end>
<start>indeed it may be too early since it is the beginning of the flight following a nightmare but the volume is far from ending<end>
<start>mdrrr<end>
<start>o it sounds good<end>
<start>then go nephis<end>
<start>honestly i do not think so<end>
<start>holy she deserves an old ugly horse<end>
<start>psq if it is done bah sunny and his clique will put - to all the others previously at their level<end>
<start>no chapter today as the author takes a break<end>
<start>and much more merite<end>
<start>i am having trouble seeing qq die and kai survive<end>
<start>you are sure you are not confounding with the shadow lord of hop kingdom<end>
<start>suffers in silence then<end>
<start>but when the same cassie who because her the moment became cold she understands that she has in front of her old man to hear from her cohort who disappeared from the memory of the world<end>
<start>in the last sunny chapters pay attention to mirrors but bitert cannot just use the eyes of groove<end>
<start>because the transfo there they had imagined his on the g-serve<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewkiss-gif-<end>
<start>i do not know if she knows but she must know<end>
<start>all titans are not big definition<end>
<start>connects his chapters<end>
<start>just not bad shibalaugh<end>
<start>and especially because the nephis character cruelly lacks dev i find since the end of the shore forgets<end>
<start>rain dreames to make this first nightmare sunny does not want to see what he is been through he does not want that for his little sister that is why he wants what wakes naturally it should be noted that sunny was very marked by ananke do not he looked for the coat and this one showed him that there was another way to climb<end>
<start>i just read the theory of and vrmt<end>
<start>yep probably tied to his soul<end>
<start>i really thought it was bit at the beginning<end>
<start>it is just efficacious<end>
<start>jtm really is finally the cbpray<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbh-spongebob-question-question-mark-idea-gif-<end>
<start>he wants to kill a ruler by being a saint<end>
<start>well i will read the rest soon before i go back and tap<end>
<start>do not let them corrupt you<end>
<start>it starts to be interesting<end>
<start>this is undoubtedly the best written volume until i read mdr<end>
<start>jet has more gear than kai<end>
<start>that is exactly what i am saying<end>
<start>we do not know the crazy prince was at what level<end>
<start>and other information<end>
<start>i cannot imagine the rest of the story<end>
<start>bahahah in real life yes it is a good person but there is definitely a moment in the work or you test it but it is not because it is wrong written<end>
<start>after the kingdoms are fragmented<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewyeah-tyrion-game-of-thrones-smile-eyebrows-gif-<end>
<start>yet i should be used to the fantastic<end>
<start>ah wait who is not up to date<end>
<start>you think kai has an attribute that tells him how beautiful he is<end>
<start>memory<end>
<start>he came for it<end>
<start>thanks guys<end>
<start>bah there are already people who had dropped this theory<end>
<start>jsp if better<end>
<start>just a sunny pussy just a kt<end>
<start>the lava is afraid<end>
<start>we forgive everything<end>
<start>okay thank you i have seen it before<end>
<start>what is the call<end>
<start>wouaaa<end>
<start>the guy is oklm on the moon without oxygen enjoying his best life shibalaugh<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>summary of chapters<end>
<start>they cannot read plutothrill<end>
<start>oh that is right<end>
<start>and she wants to break fate<end>
<start>'<end>
<start>he passed terror<end>
<start>but there are still places where it is transcendent mark when even<end>
<start>nephis flexing with the ivory tower on the guy who discovers it<end>
<start>against the use of mordert power by the domain of song is mastermind jai jure<end>
<start>jhesited but i looked at it again when i resumed<end>
<start>he can read more the description of the memories<end>
<start>but i am for<end>
<start>otherwise there is always classical methodology knowing that to pass sleepers it is always possible but actually if there are no more seeds then they will have to bury themselves<end>
<start>sleeper wears lvl it was said<end>
<start>he is so not ready for the end<end>
<start>and hop doors suddenly coming out of nowhere<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmolotov-cocktail-fire-protest-police-cops-gif-<end>
<start>there is so much spoil<end>
<start>classic sleeper yes but i think that sleeper who passes wakes up two the same may have the possibility of using it alone<end>
<start>maybe sovereign you are right c not enough<end>
<start>honestly my pref volume for now is dread night<end>
<start>the god of fire does not hold on to the one who got confused with hop in addition<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewsqueezie-ciao-nowagifs-gif-<end>
<start>but i love<end>
<start>there is nothing to keep her from it you are right<end>
<start>at the base i was reading to see the sunphi reacs ptdrr<end>
<start>but otherwise cassie raised a good point when everyone will be absorbed by the rdr how the awakens will be able to continue the path of ascension without ugliness of the exitlege<end>
<start>here you go<end>
<start>i think it is weird when her destiny is going to a place to be free from fate and actually i think it is more weaver than cassie who really is behind all this<end>
<start>against corruption the creations of vacuum this kind of thing i imagine<end>
<start>just as the god have several names may be that several line bearer could accurately represent different aspect of this line<end>
<start>chapters of interest<end>
<start>either he cannot really lose either since mordret cannot defeat him in his blade sea<end>
<start>not even<end>
<start>at least kurt more<end>
<start>the only words of the god of shadow in the second nightmare are found in the chapter in the description of the lantern of shadow<end>
<start>i have a huge smile reading these chapters i love<end>
<start>i think she sees what sy does not go in the direction of vision but rather she is omniscient in it<end>
<start>yeah that is why they have to go through a nightmare they will not have to develop their domain<end>
<start>you who reads<end>
<start>i misunderstood<end>
<start>nop no terror his class cesten function of the inheritance advance<end>
<start>here you go<end>
<start>and exploration of the hollow mountains to the shore<end>
<start>good vacation dcp you have to find a good one in there be<end>
<start>nan c'est les nuke<end>
<start>that is confirmed that<end>
<start>in the real bastion<end>
<start>it is written in walrus mtn you did to them what gray for traumas at this point<end>
<start>at the beginning yes<end>
<start>personally i have given a cockroach or a raisin like the saint of the government with his ravens<end>
<start>a guy lambda who takes control of a citadel with a mark of divinity more connected with shadows<end>
<start>a ktouille<end>
<start>effie or kai<end>
<start>premium<end>
<start>my genie<end>
<start>it is the impression i have but after all the time it is the real snake to protect aiko<end>
<start>besides i say it but for me sunny shore forget is the best version of sunny<end>
<start>it is true but one day or the other it is going to peter between valor and song it is going to be necessary for him to choose a camp or ptet that he intends to go sovereign and solo the clans mdrrrrrr<end>
<start>i did not read<end>
<start>impressive<end>
<start>mrc for gray chapz<end>
<start>the worst part is that there is a dead man and the bond is destroyed and it is even worse somehow<end>
<start>that is terrible<end>
<start>nan the last two chaps what is his how his sunny half god wesh<end>
<start>the time frozen at dusk what madness bitrate i feel it is too honest though x<end>
<start>even if he understands a little it will just disappear after<end>
<start>it must have a connection to death yes like the place where the dead rest but must exist physically<end>
<start>he will win the war<end>
<start>arthurfist<end>
<start>it is sunny<end>
<start>it is a good theory it is a good compromise i find<end>
<start>i said i am open to debate<end>
<start>this is one of the most interesting ratings of the exchange between readers i find<end>
<start>in real anvil and that i think that they have a pretty average level for suverrain<end>
<start>they were etoning and realized that the exit lege is there to make them go faster<end>
<start>i would have to reread the chap then<end>
<start>the holy term is a little abused<end>
<start>frankly i do not know he killed a lot of fat stuff when he slept<end>
<start>people<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>i want a side on the goat noctis is sure he did not die after the escape of hop<end>
<start>based a little on the description that said that the turn of the chaos war was the reappearance of weaver and that it was too late at the time he came back<end>
<start>after if you want to fire me from the channel<end>
<start>it was just a way of denouncing the betise of people who say that on cassia she has her goal she has her principles and values<end>
<start>after without her throat she dies in h<end>
<start>o but she did not change her vision<end>
<start>it is a little bit for something we will learn later too<end>
<start>especially when sunny beat him when he was still young<end>
<start>even to have everything prepared for not much<end>
<start>since it is transition i do not necessarily want to read it in detache<end>
<start>i think so but to see<end>
<start>he is crazy about the piaf it is going to be complicated<end>
<start>like very big memories i do not think he has the level to redo a key of the estuary already<end>
<start>inhumane<end>
<start>we are sure it is blood lines<end>
<start>among others<end>
<start>yes he is reason the more there is sleep there is door and they are more and more powerful<end>
<start>but it is worth kai's death<end>
<start>gray c vrmt batman left<end>
<start>we will probably find out more about clan creation etc and how the lines work<end>
<start>so nn<end>
<start>what they say<end>
<start>his normally today his again in order his daily stories<end>
<start>that is for sure<end>
<start>he must have been so stupid<end>
<start>goddamn tyrant gives birth to his whore<end>
<start>there are situations like this as long as sunny does some exceptional stuff<end>
<start>but too long to explain<end>
<start>a little bit of the volume<end>
<start>it is rest more in the direction of sleep<end>
<start>and pq not<end>
<start>the crazy turbo<end>
<start>not only chapters i was between the two via the illegal sites so i wait a week to settle down with the non-privileged chapters<end>
<start>already you can continue publishing<end>
<start>it would be against what is said in history that a tyrant controls a whole swarm of creation of his rank<end>
<start>she is going to be the favorite jet when she is going to get laid<end>
<start>it is becoming totally invisible from the tapestry of destiny<end>
<start>you are going to shoot it<end>
<start>flemme to look for the extract<end>
<start>sunny said that any mention of him disappeared so that is weird even his university essays lost their author in the eyes of the world so either the notebook has a special property or that is something else<end>
<start>it is pokemon ptn<end>
<start>she is not even a sleeper<end>
<start>black sea<end>
<start>you do not get the same gif when you hit the boot<end>
<start>theorie serious aleatory but the father of the defied child may also have lost his destiny one is very kind of blurred that is why he forgets<end>
<start>uh nothing pck it is still v i am at least late chaps on gray i think<end>
<start>because cassie she is not socially handicapped she knows very well what impact would have what she says<end>
<start>first chapter of the same part cassia goat over and over again<end>
<start>pay attention to what<end>
<start>you have already read his other book<end>
<start>we are creating a pyramid of ponzi with this work i tell you<end>
<start>we would have had a pov<end>
<start>i did a rereading not long ago i noted important chaps<end>
<start>yep that is the odds the same as if she would be fighting at the peak<end>
<start>i cannot put him in a camp the weav<end>
<start>the domain of the king of the epee can move i think seen this sentence<end>
<start>in real life yeah it would be more logical considering the huge distance that it is the song<end>
<start>jsuis deja a genre or people of indoctrin while basic they do not read novel<end>
<start>hutaodead<end>
<start>my theory about the memory of cassia will be based on the diaries which would explain how she can remember him<end>
<start>what sunny does with rain c is not a little useless because after to have attributes or even abilities it will be complicated for her<end>
<start>those who have passed his test deserve their transcendence<end>
<start>ya ptet the devil biter which is a little more dangerous<end>
<start>it would have too much impact<end>
<start>the default is not related to the exitlege<end>
<start>style shows that g master his work<end>
<start>we can know the fate of something that can destroy it<end>
<start>she has to go out through the big door<end>
<start>since the majority of the creations of the chain have a connection to the tomb or desert<end>
<start>jte understand<end>
<start>it sends heavy<end>
<start>be careful i am not on<end>
<start>sah jai kiffe a bit of slice of life melange has a bit of daction bcq of lore<end>
<start>that is clear<end>
<start>a little bit<end>
<start>then<end>
<start>he is a god his<end>
<start>it seems to me that it was said that a shadow without master is not complete so good cut the bond is not crazy<end>
<start>that is when even soon chapters the volume<end>
<start>but your chap cb<end>
<start>for chaps even though i have not read yet<end>
<start>i remember or when i finished the flight i never stopped going back<end>
<start>i do not think what will be stronger in terms of power but it will be stronger in terms of knowledge and handling of essence because she knows much better how to feel it and how it comes<end>
<start>humm<end>
<start>by the fact that these are low-level doors<end>
<start>bah nan on the contrary<end>
<start>atomise nan<end>
<start>and i am just adding the deal was in the name of wn not mine<end>
<start>and i have a theory about the reason for the coming of sunny and neph to the tomb which is obtaining the knowledge of the defaults of the sovereigns<end>
<start>hahahaha so we finally have the answer about the effie child<end>
<start>opposite<end>
<start>on the other hand one thing i want to have in the future a pov of the sovereigns that tells their same nightmare his might be genial<end>
<start>i am sorry i would read the gun<end>
<start>almost sure there is a manga or a novel do not is the synopsis<end>
<start>she was a good character<end>
<start>and you forget you tried to remember something<end>
<start>but the opposite is also possible<end>
<start>ptn i just had a theory<end>
<start>that it was sunny who killed him<end>
<start>but it is true that he is really shady<end>
<start>and that would be why its appearance would not be connected to the god of war as sunny with the god of shadow<end>
<start>rhx for chaps<end>
<start>i finished my big break<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewtroll-troll-face-gif-<end>
<start>oe but the figure is not divisible by<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbat-signal-waiting-batman-gif-<end>
<start>but neph<end>

<start>c possible<end>
<start>in real jm wait for a slice of life with personal developments after everyone has zappe sunny<end>
<start>what is it written<end>
<start>bah what ss x<end>
<start>ah nan<end>
<start>she even gave him a farm area<end>
<start>catthumbsup<end>
<start>they are going to say yeah bit and nephis in the nightmare that is why he is alive<end>
<start>i just think that like an echo he cane perso<end>
<start>legere flemme<end>
<start>the introduction of this type will be terrifying<end>
<start>nephis told her she did not see her for the same nightmare and it was not normal<end>
<start>i tome perso i really like the ending<end>
<start>for me this year before years lost dajs the kingdom of dreams and years a bastion<end>
<start>knowing that his prophecy did not match the first fight in the scarlet tower<end>
<start>nothing says he was a saint<end>
<start>httpstenorcomview me-i think-the-question-is-time-recognized-i-an-entrepreneur-the-question-quickly-recognized-hand-in-pocket-gif-<end>
<start>largely yes shibalaugh<end>
<start>i do not take any chances and i choose the escape<end>
<start>bah not since the cassy propethia corresponded to the first fight<end>
<start>may be but most of all i mean the ability as sunny to feel the element and manipulate it<end>
<start>not the aspects and attributes are completely independent of the exitlege<end>
<start>it is just anvil and song<end>
<start>possible serious<end>
<start>yes that clearly<end>
<start>it is in the recent chapters or i just forgot<end>
<start>you will know one day it will depend on gray but since it is about him and ss<end>
<start>in the idea or mtn the guv has as many saints as a major clan<end>
<start>i do not understand<end>
<start>says she said you would say that<end>
<start>i do not have words<end>
<start>he just wanted to sleep quietly<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewperfect-popcorn-michael-jackson-gif-<end>
<start>he is amazing<end>
<start>as i read it all quite quickly i tend to lose myself on the moment when some event happens<end>
<start>it is still speculation after<end>
<start>as cassie understood it she did everything to find a way to stop it<end>
<start>i do not know but i hope the adversaries are going to be up to it because the good guy is superpowering<end>
<start>i think<end>
<start>it is a memory<end>
<start>utility<end>
<start>well that is it<end>
<start>no idea i do not look at com but i think we can register more on the site to put in a few words<end>
<start>even affect the nightmare spell itself<end>
<start>but they have the link of shadow that already allows to share the boosts<end>
<start>nephis after the nuke is screwed<end>
<start>just a reflection<end>
<start>- years<end>
<start>believe what you want<end>
<start>normal wakes receive their appearance by being awakened<end>
<start>and here it is<end>
<start>very well even<end>
<start>old<end>
<start>sunny in pls<end>
<start>they will not know the sadness of realizing that there is no chapter that comes out ajd while you were waiting for them<end>
<start>o she is driving crazy<end>
<start>bah if the marks are common to all clones then he can ask a cassie to tell him the attributes of groove<end>
<start>if you are talking about me tkt i do not know what i am saying and or shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>so widely in the top if not anymore<end>
<start>uh i think they have to have it to pass transcendent exactly<end>
<start>his real name is song of the dechu and are destined to see all the world die<end>
<start>in the way of the lower sky of the chained islands<end>
<start>and the first appearance of that song she weighs her mother so much that of the king she is a bit much as much as that of the queen is pepite<end>
<start>chapter<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewzicfanccbkk-gif-<end>
<start>knowing that when he was in the pyramid he was probably already supreme<end>
<start>fortunately i do not know what i would do without ss<end>
<start>weaver mask<end>
<start>noon stop<end>
<start>but he is not wandering around too<end>
<start>wahhh but it is the d he has more access to the release<end>
<start>i do not think i am too aware that it is more the spirits than the emotions he controls<end>
<start>pepedepressed<end>
<start>it will always be interesting in any way<end>
<start>like i said if even future sunny could not convince him<end>
<start>the first nightmare the more dangerous it is the more powerful you have an attribute<end>
<start>yeah but he said he was happy to sell a memory a month and it is been in place since year so max memoirs sold that does not make much i wait to see the den with thousands of transcendent crystals<end>
<start>the you lie had so much authority<end>
<start>it is true but it is not all made the piece that benefits shibalaugh<end>
<start>aaaaahhh<end>
<start>yeah i know i just read it was not clear<end>
<start>the worst part is that it is not impossible<end>
<start>what do i like<end>
<start>for me you are just in the deni wanting to feel hate for cassie<end>
<start>mongrel he was also forgotten even if he did not have any connection with sunny officially<end>
<start>everything is relative to my dear lm if you compare a leaf to a leaf to the east<end>
<start>so this is either the mark of the exitlege gives it its appearance and its direct default to the eye<end>
<start>euff<end>
<start>i do not remember the moment<end>
<start>- cassy<end>
<start>thanks guys<end>
<start>but not quentin has succeeded a nightmare all alone nephis trier in real life<end>
<start>especially if she cannot hit her opponent<end>
<start>cassie did not want to<end>
<start>one thing i love a lot is its little details about the disappearance of sunny through their memory frame to them there is really this side of it totally excluded from the canvas of destiny and every attempt or event will try to hang it there its existence is being pushed back it is banished completely from destiny and that i begin to love the turn it takes<end>
<start>there is only sunny and can the other divine also i have a doubt<end>
<start>it is mostly your sunny so it will be a tough fight but sunny win<end>
<start>i do not smell<end>
<start>and we know that the exit has some sort of clean will<end>
<start>bah a by the emotions ya no relation<end>
<start>imagine the author changing us pov at this moment the incredible cliffhanger<end>
<start>his pleasure mrc<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewcama-main-fatal-bazooka-gif-<end>
<start>either carry died by nephis jet and bite<end>
<start>yeah for what i said i was cheating on when i said what asked sunny a way<end>
<start>sunny has the domain of the serpent king<end>
<start>kind of sunny holy relationship with the great clan and soverrain<end>
<start>i am back tonight<end>
<start>horrible<end>
<start>well now that i am a day and as i have a bit of time to lose a little opinion on this beginning v just because bringing the pov of several characters and the multi-pov sunny that is excellent diversifys a lot with regard to a before and it keeps a real coherence so it is really cool the management of the time line at the end very well manage i have worried for nothing fine volume it is super pleasant to have bits through the memories of sunny when it shows them a breaky especially that it is very well manageable for flashbacks it does not happen at the worst moment as often but there is a thing that titillates me it is this odds of it not really lost the obverse of the nightmare because it has its memory to replace all the functional part 'bracelet pratique' it is a bit too well manageable its name it only loses access to the nightmare certainly it is enorm but in fact with the explanation of 'nephis it is really enough to realize that it is a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a<end>
<start>on the other hand the news that there are at least two new areas around the forgotten shore is too good<end>
<start>it is really a shame i get caught during this moment of history i am so tempted to post chapters but i cannot otherwise i am going to get my fingers banged<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewstonks-up-stongs-meme-stocks-gif-<end>
<start>i think in her visions she does not see it<end>
<start>potential he was just waiting for sunny nightmare<end>
<start>and leads it into the hollow mountains<end>
<start>his dependence but not sunny can not beat a titan superior like his<end>
<start>or she will have to wake her face up so soon<end>
<start>i am the only one not having a tooth against pov changes<end>
<start>it was a corrupt terror that was worth a titan dechu<end>
<start>o i know<end>
<start>honestly i do not think it would bring much<end>
<start>end of dream<end>
<start>bah sup<end>
<start>then months<end>
<start>especially there are no memories to help<end>
<start>you cannot screw up in front of your girl<end>
<start>for he will be turned into a slave the second after<end>
<start>well so cassie has made sure he is destined it is not for nothing or she would never help him<end>
<start>destiny is a way of explaining the power of the scenario for g<end>
<start>as long as the seed blooms<end>
<start>t is eastern antarctica<end>
<start>we saw him when he used the mask near the biting mimic<end>
<start>he already explained why he hates his default no<end>
<start>future sunny<end>
<start>my brain<end>
<start>but in fact i know that from the moment i am going to reread even one or two chapters of ss it is good i could fall addicted to it so reading absolutely no chap it is going to hold<end>
<start>so maybe something more important<end>
<start>do not forget that he can absorb with the lantern<end>
<start>i have to go read me heartache again<end>
<start>to give his opinion already<end>
<start>mongrel is he therefore is part of his existence<end>
<start>what do we have to expect<end>
<start>it reads fast but it is when it is even too long<end>
<start>you are debating what<end>
<start>then we are not going to lie to each other the goat is still bitten<end>
<start>and he can create his memories<end>
<start>yeah but there is one that needs to keep an eye on it<end>
<start>bahn<end>
<start>asterion that will arrive in the middle of the war in pure legend<end>
<start>the daemon of rest is bound to the god of dreams<end>
<start>because they say they use all their saint plus the sovereign to defeat it<end>
<start>he is got a sick scaling<end>
<start>will enjoy the chapters instead of coming here<end>
<start>make love not war<end>
<start>but not a dead baby though i have no memory of that ahah<end>
<start>derrickthinking<end>
<start>but keep reading the number of crazy chaps you are going to eat your steps pret shibalaugh<end>
<start>it is on the understanding that the assault will be easy thanks to all the strategies of the mad prince and the tormentor and that the part that really mattered was the estuary<end>
<start>we know paa<end>
<start>take this you are going to need it for the next one<end>
<start>and that is bad for their business<end>
<start>ptdrr i am in sunny theories it is crazy<end>
<start>that is how i understood it anyway<end>
<start>yeah but it would be time to really explain the situation we just know that people he loved were lying to him but we do not know who<end>
<start>but it says it depends on the domain so i think the daeron domain is water is the more powerful your domain is the more powerful you can use the authority of its domain since this is not your main domain you must lack mastery over it<end>
<start>you are not the most divine beast in the kingdom of dreams<end>
<start>sunny when he really realizes it is jet telling him he smells death<end>
<start>a tyrant and i am not sure he saw a conviction<end>
<start>so it was a cassie writing of the pass<end>
<start>in addition to crack capacity<end>
<start>i will enjoy it<end>
<start>pov laspect of groove one punch man<end>
<start>so in theory jet has more connection with asterion than kai<end>
<start>but bcp enjoying no food is not as good as having a bit of a banger<end>
<start>oh but i love it like this<end>
<start>i think i misunderstood something<end>
<start>uh jsp<end>
<start>what is going on here<end>
<start>flames and shadow exist together and separately<end>
<start>drink to forget<end>
<start>reddox saw the divine light<end>
<start>emptiness corrupted<end>
<start>the goal of neph it was decided by weaver so it has no objective<end>
<start>now it is the arch convoy that contains a part lo<end>
<start>bah if who does not dream to go in the cellar of an unknown shibalaugh<end>
<start>well it seems to me he killed her wanting to be free but i do not see what caused this<end>
<start>then he can regret and would prefer a quieter life or with less problems even if he was not really happy as we do not know what is going to happen we do not know why he regrets it<end>
<start>until he decides to let them out of the rdr<end>
<start>that would have been masterclass<end>
<start>this<end>
<start>because there was too much revelation and the scene daction was banker we found a sunny in the same tps too weak at some point and therefore forced to flee and a sunny on cheese that destroyed everything<end>
<start>bah as axel said he can practice the first stages but that is all<end>
<start>cassie is not weaver<end>
<start>not on because sunny explains that mastery is just controlling the gasoline almost perfect way<end>
<start>what are the two divine memories of sunny<end>
<start>if she does not think about it already<end>
<start>the same as her brothers and sure not<end>
<start>i really like the words i use<end>
<start>and in fact i do not think that as ruler he can kill the bird even if for the moment it is that a cursed terror must not forget that the bird has escaped the gods to the deamons and weaver<end>
<start>real for us who read that your trad i am talking it adds more suspense to it x<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmario-mario-depressed-mario-walking-in-rain-mario-sad-depressed-gif-<end>
<start>guys i recommend you go take a ride on the discord of guilty guild it organizes an event for the end of the volume and they do a fan art contest on itself theme and there is crazy sacre<end>
<start>globally everybody would not care<end>
<start>this is good because it allows you to follow events necessary but good a bit annoying at the moment i am going to<end>
<start>sunny can just fuck up<end>
<start>it is going to make another sacred story<end>
<start>the sovereigns and the bird of shit<end>
<start>chapter<end>
<start>ahaha your sight<end>
<start>this end of the bow is amazing<end>
<start>she had some<end>
<start>of course she fights mainly at the epee but a weapon of this level that has the crazy adaptability it is always useful for level to several situations of fighting and nephis is when even gifted with several types of weapon i think after that it is me i can also be mistaken x<end>
<start>p'tit weaving<end>
<start>do not know what to do<end>
<start>and say you still have not announced that do not you talked to me<end>
<start>after this is personal i know that some prefer even the original versions because the phrase turns are adapted<end>
<start>every daemon is a fragment of the god of dreams the god forgets<end>
<start>light guide<end>
<start>the prophecy of cassia on the shore forgets it was an angel of light or fire something of the kind that is eaten by shadows<end>
<start>fooling about crazyness<end>
<start>even if it is for a few moments<end>
<start>since i have got it the better i have been<end>
<start>well if it is mongrel there is just no one who remembers<end>
<start>he is strong that g-rouble<end>
<start>it would not have changed anything other than putting an extra weight on the sunny's cyou are if she told her<end>
<start>since there is no guys who have a tp capacity and power in connection with shadows and a lv of saint<end>
<start>launch the church jet plutot<end>
<start>furiomg<end>
<start>it is too bad i find<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>bah of memory said that the fact that the cohort forgets by force any connection between them and sunny is due to the daemon of forgetfulness<end>
<start>its seems possible because the seeing that we have a whole fucking region that reacts at its current height<end>
<start>yeah i think it is still early<end>
<start>unfortunately anvil threw his son through the window while he knew for his extra appearance he wanted to kill nephis during his first nightmare<end>
<start>the opinion on his teacher<end>
<start>sunny became subaru ok<end>
<start>for the blow when you see his hate for sunny when he smells like a dreamy being on him<end>
<start>jet<end>
<start>yes it is deni<end>
<start>oh ptn thanks for these incredible chaps<end>
<start>i will read about it<end>
<start>very good choice<end>
<start>well i cannot imagine the last message<end>
<start>and bizzarrous cassia<end>
<start>yeah exactly something like that but with good dev it can be super interesting<end>
<start>otherwise romance is perfectly written neither too fast nor too slow<end>
<start>even if the saints are ultra powerful you have more than anything else<end>
<start>he said that this makes it difficult to manage mentally<end>
<start>the glow up that recyou by becoming a saint with its transformation into such cool dragon<end>
<start>it is different<end>
<start>my bad<end>
<start>realistic<end>
<start>strongly the preventive strike of sunny dcp<end>
<start>you never held<end>
<start>is what it will really finally be recognized<end>
<start>all this for a bed huh<end>
<start>anyway i am going to read again qlq chap before i sleep<end>
<start>just a caulia<end>
<start>finally<end>
<start>may be that he wants to free his father<end>
<start>fact even sunny and neph would not hold<end>
<start>no worries<end>
<start>sunny used her fault even against the reflection so bitert learned it like that<end>
<start>or pass it and are future are between melee<end>
<start>more g happens tt dr to make us understand we are in which person<end>
<start>for nephis it is not just the crazy prince who kills her<end>
<start>i do not know<end>
<start>the revelation of mad so the field of nephis is in the heart of all people what inspiration<end>
<start>so we do not know that is a supposition from you<end>
<start>that would be hilarious<end>
<start>it is going to be hard to make theories<end>
<start>her questioning and the thing she says what she knows even when she dies<end>
<start>rooohhh<end>
<start>break the clown hides under a goat and efuses the goat hides under a clown<end>
<start>he does not want her to become dependent on the exit leg if he is dead<end>
<start>it seems to me that all the awakens can more or less recover fragments like they shared them at the shore forget and the memories it is more a capacity of sunny with its connection to weaver<end>
<start>oh come on you flatter me<end>
<start>tonight's chapters are the last of the volume<end>
<start>in the nightmare he used the effect of the crown to succeed in improving the nephis epe<end>
<start>the other day we talked about the lines and the way do not it was passed on and well for the line of the god of war anvil and his brother both are and it comes from one of their parents so it is transmitted well genetically and probably to all the children linfo comes from g<end>
<start>but they have to beat nephis even outside their domain<end>
<start>the shadow is deeper bound to sunny than an echo has a normal person<end>
<start>short of the blow we can beat in a few days if you want but i cannot give my arguments shibalaugh<end>
<start>cassie goat for the moment again sah<end>
<start>i did not care too<end>
<start>we just cannot figure out his plan yet<end>
<start>thank you the g<end>
<start>i read too fast so i remember that the end of the chapter<end>
<start>well he thinks years i believe but we do not really know how long shekels last<end>
<start>no i am going to start from the beginning and for now i can hold back so i am still patient<end>
<start>his appearance is nerve a beccause of sunny who lost his destiny<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewveeunus-spongebob-spongebob-squarepanters-squidward-done-gif-<end>
<start>if an ordinary human kills a nightmare monster he gets a reward or nothing<end>
<start>tyris<end>
<start>after perhaps that territorial domains are part of the domains kind all domains can become more powerful with citadels and each can also with another particularity have the epee mark of anvil the desire for nephis<end>
<start>what the fuck<end>
<start>well well you have to be careful when i am not a day i am coming here i know it is at my own risk and beads and it is my fault when i get spoiled but others are out on the gray trad do not read in and just wait to eat a major spoil when you do not expect it and you do not think you are going to have enough to spoil reading readers<end>
<start>it is always more than the rest of the world in years shibalaugh<end>
<start>the return of the goat la<end>
<start>it is a crazy thing i never remember when i changed my chapter when i know i read the story is bcp too captivating<end>
<start>it is not about the areas<end>
<start>it is not for the whole time<end>
<start>the house of the night are there because they are skillful in the water<end>
<start>a beccause of the temple<end>
<start>and since she has a divine aspect her transfo ability must be cheate too<end>
<start>it is not possible<end>
<start>the stock of the type must be macabre<end>
<start>you feel crazy if he has more cohorts he can make it all by himself<end>
<start>maybe a little shibalaugh<end>
<start>sentences are easier to read<end>
<start>style<end>
<start>maybe that is why sunny thinks he is weird<end>
<start>i think she will understand<end>
<start>fucking<end>
<start>wesh end volume means ya crazy people going spawn<end>
<start>the scene is on the trad we can share it here you think i am hesiter<end>
<start>of divine attacks nightmares<end>
<start>i did not see her like that<end>
<start>well he does not have much choice<end>
<start>sleepers have discovered a fortress but there is a blem with the portal<end>
<start>mdrr<end>
<start>rain has the same language tick as his brother damnation he finally corrupted it<end>
<start>without losing understanding of the concept<end>
<start>the nephsunny relationship continues<end>
<start>hmm okay i see<end>
<start>every revolution with the corrupt cohort lasted at least century i think<end>
<start>he is going to get so deep through history<end>
<start>she marries<end>
<start>whereas nephis and sunny on the contrary have overpowering aspects to fight so out of domain jpense they can win<end>
<start>we want suiiiiite<end>
<start>it is beautiful when even<end>
<start>i approve<end>
<start>mhhh it will probably be the case when he will be sovereign<end>
<start>haaaa<end>
<start>the majority are bound to the tomb<end>
<start>it does not prevent him from having it<end>
<start>gigachadhandshake<end>
<start>you would not dare censor a fervent hutaoner reader<end>
<start>i swear i enjoy the<end>
<start>and that ytaura ptet a little more interesting behind<end>
<start>he cracked sunny<end>
<start>you do not know that for some people it is binding<end>
<start>it could be style<end>
<start>but you are just a translator<end>
<start>he did not say he needed the crown<end>
<start>i can understand the logic but there is too much question if the key of the estuary serves as a muzzle in the sin of loneliness but also it is tool to forget its previous '' big loop'' so why it has already seen from its sunny of the pass but also why the sin of loneliness protect it<end>
<start>it was there<end>
<start>if you take the whole prophecy to the er deg that would mean that sunny's going to slam nephis mdr<end>
<start>a drama queen<end>
<start>i think it is not for now<end>
<start>not necessarily<end>
<start>they talked about it at some point but did not throw it on who it was<end>
<start>ptn c true that c shadow mtn<end>
<start>he can just improve his shadow dance ability<end>
<start>she does not remember him it is almost safe<end>
<start>if he is not nice mdrr<end>
<start>it is a lie to everyone else but it is the sunny truth<end>
<start>the door of dreams<end>
<start>no one forgets sunny<end>
<start>i forgot his crazy rank<end>
<start>um that is the whole question<end>
<start>the frerot that is ratting you he could not have waited - weeks<end>
<start>nan or then as sunny told him and nephis came back into their real body but we do not know yet where is the future of neph<end>
<start>do not want to know if even you are worried about it<end>
<start>much better than endless and debile debate<end>
<start>well if i understand where i am the sunny of the future will never exist at the same time that our sunny<end>
<start>votes bite for me already<end>
<start>yeah but we are okay with the display order for the memories it is chronological<end>
<start>this is my personal theory hand<end>
<start>well they are not much to know that leveil exists out there<end>
<start>mdr<end>
<start>less to do something special to tie up with the exit leg i think<end>
<start>we must let the chapters flow<end>
<start>it is enough that descendants have survived it is possible that it is both<end>
<start>or not before the end<end>
<start>a little late but oh there is never a delay for ss mdr like we are together we were at that time<end>
<start>i do not think that its being its domain does not look territorial as that of others bites it says its is completely different to me the we know asser can on the domains and different forms that its can take the just territorial form with the citadels<end>
<start>yeah but i do not think they had any divine aspects at all<end>
<start>there are other solutions but normally you have not seen it yet<end>
<start>but shadows also count shadows on the ground<end>
<start>but we do not know<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>then the theory becomes more logical mtn shibalaugh<end>
<start>and dcp it can make its own theories<end>
<start>well i was wrong<end>
<start>good luck<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrr the end of the chapter<end>
<start>ptite question a little debile but on the shore forgets the bloody baron it was song seishan we agree<end>
<start>it is to protect her i think<end>
<start>dcp tomorrow ya chaps<end>
<start>and i think that it is clearly at the forefront of personal life<end>
<start>not yet<end>
<start>besides it is not going to bring you anything to get really spoiled without spoiling you make your own theories and it is one of the best parts of ss<end>
<start>i reread the volume there not often for it almost threw on<end>
<start>go speed run volume<end>
<start>i was touched by the divine light<end>
<start>he literally has the line of the devil of destiny it is found at some point he can weave sons of destiny and sunny told him mm that if no one remembers him it is because the sons of destiny that bound him to others have disappeared<end>
<start>impossible too<end>
<start>crazy about crazy<end>
<start>it is too strong for now<end>
<start>actually i wonder vrm pk he still had the crown as a mad prince<end>
<start>they are the cohort<end>
<start>and snake can not copy the winter beast yet and it is not close to doing so<end>
<start>i used to count<end>
<start>they are excellent<end>
<start>i refuse<end>
<start>thanks for gray chaps<end>
<start>all those who have the tattoo are the sunny vassals<end>
<start>cassie who hangs us every time she talks<end>
<start>by the way master sean we had seen him or already<end>
<start>i saw her a long time ago when we were at the academy but she cannot remember me anymore<end>
<start>and her transfo too i wonder how she can transform this<end>
<start>the bird thief<end>
<start>normal is good<end>
<start>a thought for cassia<end>
<start>he confused the shadows physical genre and the shadows holy genre etc jpense<end>
<start>i like it<end>
<start>the mad prince had recovered fragments from his shadows<end>
<start>i am constantly up to date to notice if some here do not spoil but i also do it for my personal reading<end>
<start>the same for the lantarctic devil<end>
<start>for me after this is a theory that there is a connection with the daemon of oblivion since the events of end of nightmare occurred above his grave but it is purely theorical<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewone-gif-<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewjohny-gif-<end>
<start>a truth is not subject to debate<end>
<start>we will translate it and talk about it again<end>
<start>yes his qi must be relatively high<end>
<start>omg thank you<end>
<start>yeah it is the chap<end>
<start>middle of the chap i found xd<end>
<start>all attributes<end>
<start>they have the name the rank and description only i believe<end>
<start>jet starved<end>
<start>if they come out of the tomb<end>
<start>in itself there are several possibilities - it has not up level since sunny is too far - a groove in her er nightmare if she has a encounter like sunny an improbable thing and really strong snake sacrifices herself to save her and allow her to kill him - a huge door opened in the middle of town snake sacrifice herself to save groove<end>
<start>that will explain everything<end>
<start>they are the same or a little weaker<end>
<start>i do not think but like the valor family<end>
<start>the corrupt sunny you think he took the place of who<end>
<start>not at home<end>
<start>this scene<end>
<start>no she is going to forget what she is like to kill her<end>
<start>mmh for nephis maybe yeah but sunny future was in the estuary why nephis would be at the beginning<end>
<start>for me it is really between effie and kai<end>
<start>he is giving him a hug too strong he can die from it<end>
<start>what are you saying<end>
<start>nothing but the level of weaving<end>
<start>in real life i do not think he hates themselves they even have a similar goal they just do not agree in the ways to use to achieve this goal what often leads them to confront each other<end>
<start>i cannot believe it after all it would be stupid if he chose himself to remain a slave sincerely but i find it too simple that he gets rid of his relationship this way i know it is not simple i explain to myself that i can break it just with the well of the wishes of this way comes back to breaking a part of the exit leg by a vow and i find it less strong as a symbol than what it could have been a fight to die with neph it could have pleased me i am nephis supremacy not typing i do not necessarily want to see neph dead but good to get rid of it as it would please me no more than it even if he voluntarily chooses to stay there i really expect to know how g will do<end>
<start>at the beginning i thought it had something to do with the weak point of goliath but not at all<end>
<start>poignant conversation between sunny and cassy<end>
<start>i just thought of something stupid<end>
<start>saint of x plus pui<end>
<start>against the heart of shakat<end>
<start>you are going to get to the best part<end>
<start>if it were the case the forgotten god would have no more hearts<end>
<start>since the beginning i think you are talking about the sovereign mdr<end>
<start>she is actually a girl<end>
<start>here is something to tell me<end>
<start>that is where we will have real shore level stakes forget<end>
<start>or it would be super weird<end>
<start>well it is family<end>
<start>psq you can talk about nothing with nobody it is relou<end>
<start>or but the saint's bounty<end>
<start>the reunion i expected the most was sunny and groove<end>
<start>you even said that sunny smoked the titan sleeping but that it was kif kif with an impure beast and still she is or you have logic<end>
<start>it is a good thing that means we are still going to be a long time<end>
<start>for me the story is something else than they just killed him for power<end>
<start>i have to see what i am going to follow<end>
<start>his neen has not the area looks godgrave after sunny his would be the kingdom of the gods of the sun when i thought it was the islands broken<end>
<start>oe c possible<end>
<start>i do not think he would lose a core or the crazy prince would not have succeeded in becoming a titan<end>
<start>well that is probably going to make her shadows stronger etc<end>
<start>and sunny's definitely special extra he really has no luck on it<end>
<start>i confess mdr<end>
<start>but cursed tyrant is far too much for saints<end>
<start>feyfey<end>
<start>so since neph is a tyrant all the limbs have made it stronger<end>
<start>it is not going to change anything it is not just killing to kill it is going to have to be useful to the plot a death<end>
<start>but if he happens to know what is going on he must be strong<end>
<start>to stop on that how it stinged<end>
<start>sunny actually an allusion at a time when he is in the bastion underground<end>
<start>i am putting his do me returns on it please<end>
<start>nan normal can be teleported from the real world to the rdr<end>
<start>that is exactly it<end>
<start>and then biter came back with the cohort at the same citadel<end>
<start>effie who dies and is replaced by his kid<end>
<start>he looks like fildrong<end>
<start>it is a possibility when you think about the end of the drink that i am supposing very strongly to be the ketch dananke<end>
<start>yes in real life he loses his memory but he can weave new ones and ties to his soul himself<end>
<start>i think he did not rip out his destiny but just the real name<end>
<start>and then the sanctions are not stopped at what i put higher it may be a much lower penalty<end>
<start>weaver may have done it solo after the war or in preparation having seen fate he would have already started his plan in preview the final version of the releaselege already arriving only at the last world standing that of sunny other possibilities the other daemons have not listened to it at this moment the<end>
<start>would have to reread the first chaps around groove but jsue almost on that it is groove who did not want to make a first nightmare<end>
<start>jsuis hype afterwards as decyou by personal events<end>
<start>because already there is no four-time nightmare<end>
<start>the spectre of mordret is not bound to the god of the war of memory<end>
<start>bn<end>
<start>thank you for the chapters translated gray<end>
<start>in real without the cassia context is just ultra dumb<end>
<start>first solstice you directly send to an area at the pif of the dream kingdom and you have to get out the shore forgets for sunny<end>
<start>but his brain controls his body<end>
<start>alone shibalaugh<end>
<start>madness about the world and the power needed<end>
<start>whatever he does<end>
<start>the explanation of neph on the passage to the sovereign that lon had been waiting for for a while i was waiting for him i kuffled<end>
<start>and i hope the story around nephis is not just going to be a bad sovereign killed my dad me fight<end>
<start>i thought you were talking in the arc of the antarctic<end>
<start>incrpable<end>
<start>see if people lie by message<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewdicaprio-maybe-gif-<end>
<start>i think i will wait a good year once i have finished what the story is going well<end>
<start>about the memory i think it is going to be lubricated from the forgotten cache temple<end>
<start>the goal of sunny is just to have a groove to participate in the first nightmare<end>
<start>more maree celeste has more experience probably of the best memories an art transcending the total<end>
<start>yes he had specified but he could not recover it after but now that he is a saint he can do it i think<end>
<start>it is normal x<end>
<start>sorry i did not see you talking about heritage and no line<end>
<start>i really see on dying mdrrrrrr<end>
<start>not kai he cannot die<end>
<start>i am just updating this is really a work that gives me crazy emotions<end>
<start>bcp better<end>
<start>see how her kid jumps everywhere hard to punish him and elfie sees her personality she does what she wants<end>
<start>like that freedom finds itself turned against him<end>
<start>but short<end>
<start>the vision was not clear on it<end>
<start>fold<end>
<start>possible but his can also be the goal of weaver he loses are destiny<end>
<start>it is a good question<end>
<start>a kind of defilement<end>
<start>i think i am going to end up like you cannot wait for mdr<end>
<start>i stopped at the end of the volume pile jfinished that of lotm then i reread it and i will continue on what came out<end>
<start>so that is not my generation<end>
<start>neither will win it is nephis and sunny who will win in any way shibalaugh<end>
<start>i think he is been talking since the beginning of the volume<end>
<start>if at any time if we do not meet him we are told that one of the great priests is extravagant and lunatic we will have the return of our national noctis<end>
<start>but good in view of the rest of the story it has its place in the recit butsssss good<end>
<start>bah that is all the components of a person i have been printing<end>
<start>in truth it is not even on nephis is as much a titan with a divine aspect<end>
<start>sharp breaky<end>
<start>fortunately they did not have to face it if not end of story<end>
<start>but in the logic i will say that he is insensitive to the sortlege<end>
<start>ha nan i speak of the person who has the divine aspect in song<end>
<start>their brother and sister relationship<end>
<start>jsp but i have vrmt the impression that in ss is never nothing that is said for nothing<end>
<start>but imagine i really want to buy it i buy its or its existence at least<end>
<start>we agree<end>
<start>in the last chapter why sunny did not just try to destroy the jiade by changing the frame of the epee making it collapse on it even<end>
<start>well precisely the fact that a replica of the temple appears in its sea of blade makes me rather think that the citadel exists without the sortelege as the leveil and the aspects and that it just allows a simpler use to take possession and use it<end>
<start>take care of what you want<end>
<start>gg to be up to date his long part when you start<end>
<start>i am putting it down<end>
<start>ohv<end>
<start>i remember<end>
<start>it does not bother me<end>
<start>the goat bitert<end>
<start>goodbye<end>
<start>that is why i did not want to come back<end>
<start>shibalaugh oh oh oh i love<end>
<start>i read her in the middle of the night<end>
<start>already we had no information about anyone dead during the nightmare so kai is alive finally i think<end>
<start>ah bah for me so because he sees the sons of fate at the end of the nightmare and i think it is the true appearance of the sortlege<end>
<start>just his dcp shadow mark<end>
<start>waits for the first appearance of a superior nan<end>
<start>and<end>
<start>i am not broken the mind game are out of reach<end>
<start>besides i had seen a theory pass that the default of that song might be that she should be dead to control the dead but that her appearance would prevent her from dying again<end>
<start>i hope it is time like this their cohort of holy plaice all lantarctic<end>
<start>well the shadow realm is not like lau-de-la would have to die to get there even if it is not the first time he does it<end>
<start>he is not a hoard<end>
<start>a great terror<end>
<start>always the first nightmare<end>
<start>the other mordert nephis naeve and all<end>
<start>he already did it in antarctic to kill goliath on his memory of the siege<end>
<start>i like the return to the source the fact that every abomination is a danger and that it is necessary to analyze and prepare a plan now with holy sunny most of the fighting are simple more strategy a strictly speaking<end>
<start>or it was just to have a powerful memory or something<end>
<start>except for ladies' eclats<end>
<start>sirene shibalaugh<end>
<start>yes if he does not move<end>
<start>in either neph can nuke but with sunny shadow too<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewdrinking-inna-drunk-drinking-wine-drink-gif-<end>
<start>she retained a superior flair that opposed her abilities<end>
<start>sunny avatars it is he who controls them but that he is too smart and manages to manage the three in mm time or he managed to make sure to have a triple personnalite in relation to the fact that he is three places in mm time<end>
<start>your crack<end>
<start>just the delire mdrrr it does not serve much dogsmile<end>
<start>i am totally agreed<end>
<start>i am open to debate<end>
<start>i cannot tell if it is positive or negative<end>
<start>i will wait until then<end>
<start>he is got the cyou line<end>
<start>let me finish catching up with the trad x i am telling you if we get the cassie church but i am hot right now<end>
<start>jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<end>
<start>after this is not the first time i hear about a 'final fight' between the two but seen the precision of the cassia prophecies<end>
<start>we do not know<end>
<start>he totally lost the chief exit leg<end>
<start>but recent events support my theory that he has not completely lost his destiny<end>
<start>ah bah mtn you know x originally delire was from leffie church but little by little for obvious reasons that i will not quote arthurfist members left one to one leaving me alone until i changed nick week<end>
<start>especially that even sunny nen will not be satisfied in the end<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewdieudonnca-chut-silence-gif-<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>chapters<end>
<start>i had talked about it we know that the rdr eats little by little the real world i had theorized that every region has a creature reference so the winter beast for the antarctic<end>
<start>really impose you and learn their universal truth<end>
<start>or at least we do not know<end>
<start>as for example a wake becomes master without necessarily mastering gift essence<end>
<start>i was rolled in the flour by this same high ruler<end>
<start>normally the wounds should have disappeared as with daeron<end>
<start>it is just that right now jet<end>
<start>we should just finish the book and start the jespere war<end>
<start>the true iron lady<end>
<start>she said she can use one of her cores as fuel<end>
<start>i am starting to understand my moment or i will finish<end>
<start>- chapter<end>
<start>you know what<end>
<start>probably the same<end>
<start>i have a doubt<end>
<start>i would be surprised if the guns took months to see each other<end>
<start>we will see but for me it came from the<end>
<start>well i say it again but thanks for the chaps<end>
<start>he is<end>
<start>yeah sunny i forgot that at the beginning he was a little mentally unbalanced<end>
<start>then he is<end>
<start>actually i do not see nephiscassiesunny dying already<end>
<start>but it is true it is very scary<end>
<start>it is not the only one i think but it is the one who mintrigues the most personal<end>
<start>it is literally writing black on white<end>
<start>above<end>
<start>there are portals categorizing everywhere<end>
<start>he is doing rugby<end>
<start>the line of weaver is therefore that of the god forgets therefore ptet that sunny will later have aspects related to dreams<end>
<start>pepperwood<end>
<start>eurys<end>
<start>jsp is how the classic hard of a nightmare for the saints<end>
<start>the vlog jet during the battle mdr<end>
<start>yes<end>
<start>what thanks the chapter thanks gray<end>
<start>the same nightmares of sunny where he will play the role of one of the godsdaemon<end>
<start>especially that there is no language in english but when<end>
<start>he has not already taken a part of weaver because after what i understood the prohibition line would be that of the god forget each daemon is part of it so each daemon gives one of their characteristics<end>
<start>i like the interactions between the two too much<end>
<start>in real neph i imagine it too much in varay mode in tbate<end>
<start>but hate to see this lord of the shado<end>
<start>it was really chilly<end>
<start>lack of time<end>
<start>after you may be right<end>
<start>the encyclopedia of ss<end>
<start>maybe also<end>
<start>i will take both of them in the same way as he does<end>
<start>yeah that is normal<end>
<start>nan since bones is weaver's heritage too<end>
<start>i have been a zgeg for more years i thought it was like this because i never focused on the names of the people<end>
<start>you may hop<end>
<start>basically he answers questions about his discord and he says it there but on his discord you can find messages that can spoil the last english chap<end>
<start>i will see you in chapter one<end>
<start>the spectrum that has well comforted sunny all along<end>
<start>only sacred<end>
<start>or you are talking about the daemon<end>
<start>it was when<end>
<start>just to recipitulate impure beast takes the physics that any dormant titan takes intelligence combat intelligence ability<end>
<start>and give them additional capabilities<end>
<start>if dcp happens to free themselves or change the relationship of the shadow leap in real life it would have no more reason to hide it nan<end>
<start>yeah not fake he will probably keep the link and he will be a little modified<end>
<start>nan it is g in question answer when it is out<end>
<start>and indeed the daemons each lived in a particular region but they were regions in connection with the divine kingdoms or not necessarily or i am squarely too focused on the rd<end>
<start>it could be both so much and so little<end>
<start>it can not sunny even tells it its appearance is purely offensive whereas creation is a characteristic of the utilitarian aspects as sunny has half or completely utilitarian bite<end>
<start>shibalaugh manure<end>
<start>do not worry<end>
<start>saint sunny<end>
<start>crazy<end>
<start>spoil and not just once my asshole<end>
<start>i left my feeling in comment on the site but honestly i have never loved so much a work of my life that is very strong what is going on<end>
<start>they are all good at actually saying like the nightmare with noctis was pretty good at the same as the antarctic<end>
<start>i think cassie did more for him than nephis so<end>
<start>attention brain reversal in some chapter laughs<end>
<start>nn had a connection with the field<end>
<start>i do not think he is going to expand again<end>
<start>that sdf<end>
<start>but respect is dead something else<end>
<start>so i have had the time<end>
<start>it is not during the antarctic when he talks with this division<end>
<start>his is funny<end>
<start>for now we have more or less confirmation for nephis and sunny but the others actually we are in the blur<end>
<start>ah possible<end>
<start>i am not sure that sunny faces the smart guy in front of a corrupt terror<end>
<start>the sovereigns and the cohort ptet certain people type morgan and seishan<end>
<start>who wins<end>
<start>i can join the church of cassia there<end>
<start>pipo imp chan supremacy<end>
<start>and that mtn ya asterion walking in space<end>
<start>it is called the divine kingdom it is not for nothing<end>
<start>i think i am doing a good break<end>
<start>i have hate xd<end>
<start>from that moment on<end>
<start>no no other thing<end>
<start>but you can just spoil a little<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewhaha-fundy-batman-gif-<end>
<start>i do not like linfo so it is fake<end>
<start>i should not have opened this reading channel ss now let us go noproblemcrying<end>
<start>httpscnddiscordappattachmentsgif<end>
<start>alone as a saint he already hunts higher demons i believe<end>
<start>bah it can become nep again<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>it would not have helped if she forgot when she read her notes<end>
<start>nn trkl i doubted a little<end>
<start>yeah it is just nephis to use it is fragment for her nuke and she had to unlock a liability similar to sunny<end>
<start>the royue of dreams is the kingdom of the same god so the sortlege is the process that allows people to rise<end>
<start>with a fish poti with them<end>
<start>this<end>
<start>who tells you that the release was created for this<end>
<start>aaah bites but in the end sunny it is even more crazy than him<end>
<start>yeah but recovers the exitlege cest recovers its destiny its connection with nephis etc<end>
<start>we do not know if she is seeing the sunny news right now<end>
<start>sah the benger<end>
<start>now he is going to shut up for min<end>
<start>if we omit the context<end>
<start><end>
<start>he cannot say he is a mongrel<end>
<start>on the other hand with all the humans who are traveling in antarctica will be full of new awakens because all humans will get seeds of the nightmare<end>
<start>they move him too fast and nephis<end>
<start>okay i do not see the shade for now but i would understand better when we see their powers later i guess<end>
<start>what was the context<end>
<start>in two days i got up to date on the vo<end>
<start>but i think because in terms of spending gas lady her has to hit hard mdr<end>
<start>everything is logical and connects for now<end>
<start>spoil chap apparently bit the prince of nothing welcomed them to dusk<end>
<start>sir starts at h and come and tell me it is funny<end>
<start>on the other hand jadore tjr how sunny gives a shit about kai vrm c magistral<end>
<start>the memory of the first pancakes and waffles<end>
<start>that would mean he will not have to turn off his estate he will have one in his own sea of the world<end>
<start>the volume is not yet finished i do not think against<end>
<start>knowing that the antarctic has it when it does well push its cores<end>
<start>i am too stupid<end>
<start>avoid bastion if you go to the beach there are some sea problems on fire<end>
<start>in the fed y'a clauses - as soon as your user falls into a nightmare make him crash in the water<end>
<start>and also jet<end>
<start>on the other hand i do not understand too much those who hang on the channel without being day on gray<end>
<start>it is like chapters jpeux do not take it seriously with the name<end>
<start>if the chapters<end>
<start>it is not a spoil of the work but you will see<end>
<start>rain she will learn that sunny is her brother answer yes or not only please i am not up to date<end>
<start>nan precisely you consider it less important because it is the least developed member of the cohort in history it would not be impacting enough in my personal opinion i do not see the interest to kill kai<end>
<start>the volume ends in chapters i advise people who are not a day to wait for me to post the chapter<end>
<start>that is what i would have done perso dung<end>
<start>because by def the gods are a little selfish and proud<end>
<start>logic<end>
<start>i expect more at an end to the image of volume<end>
<start>in tt case really the chaps are crazy cassy which proves again what the goat of this work is<end>
<start>ptn introduction dasterion she is amazing what he jerks on the moon him<end>
<start>he is got a lot of improvement that is not tied to soulweave<end>
<start>as tjrs<end>
<start>of strong proba<end>
<start>there you go<end>
<start>traders can all be wakes<end>
<start>i have a theory that makes itself day by day like that sunny is weaver<end>
<start>i said shadow and shadow<end>
<start>thanks boss but you are or<end>
<start>she must be so happy i would even say she must feel full<end>
<start>there is a difference between dream realms and spring<end>
<start>you mean<end>
<start>actually would that really be her goal to her if she was influenced by weaver to want it<end>
<start>nullard<end>
<start>so as long as he does not want to move godgrave he is not going to try<end>
<start>and he is not even sure to recover his destiny<end>
<start>he is going to give her a well-lit chinese dress in memory<end>
<start>there is no reveote limit<end>
<start>so to speak<end>
<start>like prince of nothing psq we took away his valor heritage etc<end>
<start>a pov of cassenephis mtn would have been banked<end>
<start>p'tite theorie in her fourth nightmare sunny will appear in water<end>
<start>i was not going to do that<end>
<start>that was style<end>
<start>he had an infinite time to progress<end>
<start>if they want to talk about the english chaps they go on the serv offi<end>
<start>but his name is the same<end>
<start>so already anvil and valor in general are probably well aware that nephis could betray them then never nephis would fall into the panel if valor murdered master sunless especially with what she knows about war<end>
<start>i think the more the story will advance more sunny will get closer to the weaver line rather than that of the god of shadow<end>
<start>after cassie does not seem to understand that sunny wants to have a relationship with nephis without her masterful bond<end>
<start>mrc the g for chaps<end>
<start>when jy thinks cassie has two her like the one before the nightmare that manipulates the cassie after the same nightmare<end>
<start>with a little luck they will have their divine appearance that goes pop at them<end>
<start>the same<end>
<start>it has shadow that is with groove the real body a shadow to the shop and the other a godgrave<end>
<start>a treat<end>
<start>holy snake nightmare cane perso jsuis sad fielon j confess blc<end>
<start>i am not going to say the opposite shibalaugh<end>
<start>i guess it is the sortlege that gives this feeling so that the awakenings do their duty i imagine<end>
<start>well it was just the goal but he would have been corrupting the forgotten god would have absorbed the deamon that we are participating in the war and seen that the sortlege was created by his children i do not see why he would not be able to change it a little bit but he misses weaver to take full control of it because i think weaver has succeeded in not being absorbed by the forgotten god<end>
<start>i did a word search and i did not read it all<end>
<start>curious to see how it will evolve but a hair decus we will really find ourselves before chap or nephis and sunny will finally kiss it is rather frustrating<end>
<start>i do not think so but it is not unlikely<end>
<start>his original plans are sure he has ambition after i know if it has to change i am not yet the catscreen<end>
<start>she said it at some point that she could not see the avatar of the lord of shadows<end>
<start>and i do not think he was that crazy for having succeeded in drawing up such a complex plan already sunny is not always stable<end>
<start>but trql<end>
<start>knowledge of who the wounds are<end>
<start>though i just thought of a little ling<end>
<start>because he was corrupt and there was the guard who kept him from entering<end>
<start>he can send like sovereign at the same time<end>
<start>but the first doors we do not know where they appeared<end>
<start>that is only what he gets in the nightmare that can be considered a reward<end>
<start>intro of the sovereigns<end>
<start>maybe the moon<end>
<start>that volume was just too perfect<end>
<start>so either he will have to learn to do without or he will have to learn to create his own interface<end>
<start>it is a crazy thing to have chap chill like her<end>
<start>it is not a concept of the sortlege if the sortlege would not exist humans when even wake up and all the tralala with the solstice<end>
<start>but then we did not see all the ability of the butterfly i think<end>
<start>but going from chapdays to<end>
<start>nothing that the introduction of the sovereigns is incredible we learn so much about them in just half a chapter<end>
<start>something like that<end>
<start>i would like to note all my theories since the beginning of ss and read everything again at the end of ss mdrr<end>
<start>but the chaps become interesting the jsp how it will evolve<end>
<start>especially when you have never seen her<end>
<start>but one thing is about these powers works well on sunny even without destiny<end>
<start>but i will not be surprised if it is a pov ravenheart<end>
<start>yeah but i can see that i am going to follow nephis to create the sword the war will come very quickly<end>
<start>attention to vows<end>
<start>its damage to the soul too<end>
<start>i am debile i confused sirene and meduse so i correct in my thoughts i consider it a meduse<end>
<start>and also how long is spent in the real world<end>
<start>knowing that in the same nightmares their final boss was ceasing a tyrant superieur and that it filled another superieur the same may be filled dimura impossible solo it according to me<end>
<start>but even around it said that all the visionaries had felt a disturbance and that their power worked less well than before<end>
<start>ahmmtao<end>
<start>ah batman it is gray x<end>
<start>but damn it all of you come in the same time if you have to ptn he is got sunny balls even if he is wearing the mask<end>
<start>really very funny this volume since some chapters<end>
<start>yes but the great father might not have the line<end>
<start>this guy scares me<end>
<start>these two are very much alike<end>
<start>and now that he is a saint he must be super powerful in addition to the fact that he has the same capacity as his double nightmare<end>
<start>bof c'est pas des titans cursed or impuresshibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>spoil<end>
<start>if i have just found in the chapter that to become holy needs an aspect<end>
<start>but i do not see how he loses<end>
<start>like i am having a hard time seeing a stranger add to the group given all that the basic cohort went through<end>
<start>they manage entrances and exits in their domain<end>
<start>it is not just a titan superior<end>
<start>then we avoid talking about it<end>
<start>okay fine thanks<end>
<start>what did you not understand<end>
<start>it is that no matter what no one could ever have<end>
<start>and you will have another chapter<end>
<start>i cannot imagine with neph ptn<end>
<start>people will realize he was too strong<end>
<start>but then it would be when not even for a while i think because in not long there will be the war between song and valor it is not at this moment the they are going to go around the world and the war will probably be long so it will probably be in the volume in real life if we refer to the current hard one volume would - month at least<end>
<start>chief his made years he is walking around the dream realm how you want cassie to find him when he is no one in the same tps and he would dodge<end>
<start>jy thought but i am thinking it would be too simple after we know that sunny was able to anchor to his real because what his is is it vrm possible to have some we do not know but the theory seems acceptable to me personally i think he will be successful in forging a real name or finding one at the bottom of his soul or finding a way to anchor again to his old real name<end>
<start>maybe in real life i do not know how much is in the song field maybe it would wake up once it comes out<end>
<start>there is so much incredible revelation in the last one<end>
<start>hehe<end>
<start>it is surprising to talk about beauty for sunny of course he is a saint mtn but it is never been so prominent<end>
<start>nephi orders work remotely or sunny must be worn<end>
<start>as commander-in-chief of the cassy fc yes<end>
<start>it is even slightly resembling<end>
<start>that is right mb i had zap<end>
<start>even if i am not sure that the dog swears fidelity to the singing domian<end>
<start>ptdr free of charge<end>
<start>oe but grievously<end>
<start>at that moment i would do the same<end>
<start>but nephis it makes sense she ignites the souls so it connects it psyche with its appearance<end>
<start>but at least i go back to the volume while being hype and not the reverse<end>
<start>okay thank you<end>
<start>well he picked up his citadel recently since we know when he picked it up<end>
<start>especially that cassie did this to have a gun as she says in the last chapter<end>
<start>more than on anemoneshibalaugh<end>
<start>she only lives because of her essence<end>
<start>when he came back<end>
<start>tkt ahah but in itself it was a kind of underwater flower but otherwise the sybils are cense of human appearance<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewpicsou-scrooge-mcduck-gif-<end>
<start>seeing that sunny is a famous star<end>
<start>i am rushing to finish to get the answers but at the same time the more i advance the closer i get to the chaps i am going to get drunk when i read everything<end>
<start>one's holding the other<end>
<start>i am going to eat well in the part i feel what a banger ss when even<end>
<start>then he may have lied but i would not have seen the point of doing it<end>
<start>at least effie is always faithful to her even<end>
<start>i hope my brain survival monkas<end>
<start>you never know better to warn than to heal<end>
<start>and dcp nn also<end>
<start>in worth does not mean just v they are extremely useful buff etc<end>
<start>it is not a weapon it is an object<end>
<start>full speculation that says<end>
<start>she kind of assimilated it<end>
<start>the last four<end>
<start>you will soon be part of what found him<end>
<start>other than its attribute<end>
<start>nan is because the dance of the shadow is its aspect heritage so it is directly linked to its appearance and its soul it has not lost its appearance so for heritages of similar aspect it is just that the sortlege can give it more when it progresses<end>
<start>sunny tells him even she also took advantage of some events<end>
<start>the lantern is already of divine rank you want it to evolve in what<end>
<start>more difficult yes but they still win<end>
<start>it changes all visions of cassia<end>
<start>just put it down<end>
<start>which lasted a long time<end>
<start>finally if he really lost her may be something else<end>
<start>i think not look at the second nightmare he cannot talk but he answers with movements of head and gestures to elyas aloud means that he can just think what he wants i think<end>
<start>but the daemon forgets i hope it will be more useful<end>
<start>i am taking a vacation day<end>
<start>at the same time as a spee talks to you all day long<end>
<start>i still cannot figure it out<end>
<start>thank you grayy<end>
<start>like that song that is quiet with a spee in the torso<end>
<start>but i think it would be nice to have her<end>
<start>bah nether has the most in-depth knowledge about the souls<end>
<start>chap i have no brain for the time repere time catscream<end>
<start>when you read chapj you do not have time to go back to bed<end>
<start>on the other hand so that sunny does not want cassie to see it is memory of the last year he really had to do some crazy things<end>
<start>justice is not waiting<end>
<start>well instead of shipping you have got it<end>
<start>that is enough to understand<end>
<start>or a lady core of choice<end>
<start>well before he was born we thought it was going to be effaced because good<end>
<start>yeah looks like he is the smartest of the gods<end>
<start>oh i am tired<end>
<start>gender first name name date of birth<end>
<start>after i am not the type to share the advance of my reading so you will really see me when i am up to date<end>
<start>proof or fake<end>
<start>read instead of asking questions<end>
<start>or i am the one who smoked<end>
<start>weaving true memories already<end>
<start>he must find a seed<end>
<start>if not a saint<end>
<start>she can see the information of the people who created the nightmare but not objects<end>
<start>of the piece of the domain of shadow<end>
<start>after neph comes back i guess it is going to grow faster but when<end>
<start>o may be<end>
<start>he would have wanted to put game of throne but he did not have the rights<end>
<start>and she did not want to risk it for her parents<end>
<start>this passage is hilarious in its way to be difficult to translate<end>
<start>more access to nightmare more access to memory drop<end>
<start>nan was practically instantane<end>
<start>more damage on the am<end>
<start>oh my catmonsob cassia my deesse abehyperneko<end>
<start>we are argh cards<end>
<start>i remember he made a recap a while ago<end>
<start>maybe she did not know my consequences<end>
<start>because it will turn into a region but the region is smaller than the real basic world<end>
<start>the fight starts a few unpredicted to make it more realistic but when even cool<end>
<start>he won everything the sunny shabalaugh<end>
<start>the guy's so crazy that he drives his old man crazy to come back to life<end>
<start>i am not sure you realize the abyss there is<end>
<start>widesusge<end>
<start>and that i hope also because good revenge in itself ok it understands but in front of the whole lore of ss it makes the fad thing in front of the huge possibilities of creating a real development behind and that little one learns that it is a cursed line for example or i do not know any other reason that would implement in the lore at this level<end>
<start>hot or cold pq<end>
<start>it is a little easier with<end>
<start>her max should be like jpense<end>
<start>i will do it again<end>
<start>mea culpa<end>
<start>they know each other well and are similar so the duo would be crazy<end>
<start>oe ok pq you ask yourself<end>
<start>what crack gray<end>
<start>so i have to stop reading shd<end>
<start>it is possible but it would be less funny<end>
<start>the two people who flirt with the female lead are me<end>
<start>dcp it must be the titan dechu in antarctica<end>
<start>yes i agree<end>
<start>cbpray cbpray<end>
<start>i do not think he is moving the domain because jsp if that is it but i understand otherwise<end>
<start>but she is going to have wings that would stick too well to the person<end>
<start>not the no<end>
<start>just goddave what again<end>
<start>but when sunny talked about the piaf's plan to get his destiny back i thought he must have left the tomb<end>
<start>throw the fowl<end>
<start>it says that it is a temple that addresses all the gods and not only the one of the shadow but that this day the only shadow has resonated with the call of sunny<end>
<start>it is not a joke this time<end>
<start>i understood that the estate was not a godrave but just on the nameless temple<end>
<start>after there are actually points that make sunny more useful to live valor<end>
<start>non-shibalaugh<end>
<start>sunny would have had the final decision<end>
<start>the winter beast apart from its cold not a real fight<end>
<start>it is too smart my sunny transformation allows a g to change the rhythm of history ultra fast<end>
<start>but if your idea of something added to me i will because i say above i tjr pdf if there are things to change<end>
<start>yeah that might be interesting<end>
<start>the dead teacher do not i forgot the name<end>
<start>yeah i get it too<end>
<start>you do not have to shock them when a covid crisis comes<end>
<start>oh it is just a tyrant wakes up shibalaugh at his sunny age he was killing them without lifting his little finger shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>but she will still be infected if she wakes up<end>
<start>yeah basically that is kind of it<end>
<start>c for what i thought had been a larry for a while<end>
<start>the right ref<end>
<start>if so remove what i said<end>
<start>wait for you to tell me you think seishan the one who remains blocks years on the shore forgets you think it is the sovereign of song<end>
<start>i only ask this<end>
<start>i hope they do not just go out after they get home<end>
<start>we do not know man<end>
<start>good it is an old screen<end>
<start>reminds them that there can only be one true cult<end>
<start>with the message requests i did not really indicate you could have waited a long time you did well to ping shibalaugh<end>
<start>i confess without a nightmare<end>
<start>a full power<end>
<start>ptn the third nightmare really the bonus ss<end>
<start>but by contrast<end>
<start>he had a real name as descendants of the god of the shadow so why not with a real name related to weaver<end>
<start>okay so oe can be lord or duc<end>
<start>no more than chapters<end>
<start>on patreon if there is a premium but as he asked me that left those available on rr '<end>
<start>if he zeros qi powers he does not have and weapons yes<end>
<start>in truth i reflected well after having read the chap if the supremes are abandoned land it is plot every awakening and ascension creates doors and it is inevitable in addition it limits the ascension to be able to control the power<end>
<start>moe<end>
<start>he probably just did not venture into the hollows and went straight to the nameless temple on the other hand why he was not in the hollows in his mirror world jsp i do not remember how this capacity works anymore<end>
<start>i do not even have to prepare for a year ago<end>
<start>so much what he is looking for would be the best for him<end>
<start>not<end>
<start>i dream of the day or holy place a word<end>
<start>i do not think it is that way either but it is one of the only ones that is sure<end>
<start>i am not going to give you a fr class but a rhetoric question most of the time you are supposed to understand that she is rhetoric<end>
<start>you come back at the right time<end>
<start>you think weaver knows the existence of sunny<end>
<start>any power he accumulates will be his own<end>
<start>that would have made nice side-story<end>
<start>sscassiepopcorn<end>
<start>little theorie quickly made sunny managed to break fate i do not know how and the sortlege can no longer interact with it than one who broke fate<end>
<start>or a better understanding of destiny<end>
<start>but solace also means loneliness<end>
<start>that cassie ugly or what it says does not change anything<end>
<start>i am going to reread the chap eh shibalaugh<end>
<start>you want to do justice to yourself i am going out of the cape just for you<end>
<start>if they die in real life i prefer to see what will happen rather than bet on someone is death<end>
<start>or it would explain his dissident with the deesse of the temples<end>
<start>nan in real sunny who travels in the hollow mountains just to get a bed is to finish me shibalagh<end>
<start>that once become holy<end>
<start>he will be nice to him<end>
<start>i do not see what you find her is a good persono yes she is funny maybe she is serious she is been put forward at times but when you have got some broken sides<end>
<start>i remember when i first read i thought it was part of a crazy lore<end>
<start>not like i am reading<end>
<start>he haunts me<end>
<start>you will see another explanation<end>
<start>jet mdr<end>
<start>it is so much better than all the crappy theories that people were swinging without reflecting<end>
<start>in any case it makes us realize how much you take legal risks a trade gray on ten owes a clear<end>
<start>ptet groove seen its name if its fact as sunny its appearance will have a relation to the rain or time in general<end>
<start>he does not say it directly in fact with his memories that he showed him to show him the shore but not to the epoch before being erased from destiny so it is after and it is technically not sunny but simply someone who has the same appearance and the same name as well as the same powers except that thanks to the places and acts that he showed cassie guesses directly that this is clearly the road that she and nephis took so she doubts that he was with them the beginning knowing that she already understood that sunny and they knew each other before but that she forgot it<end>
<start>sunny could eat it also technically<end>
<start>little being on the other hand i am afraid we will start slowly going in the ball at the level of power once the level of supreme is reached because at the moment it will be the most powerful being existing after the creations of the nightmare<end>
<start>gllips that fall perfectly well<end>
<start>we did not see the encounter with mordret<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewforest-gump-wave-hi-hello-how do you-gif-<end>
<start>at least end the flight<end>
<start>something like that<end>
<start>in my memory<end>
<start>did they not just drop a bomb she knows about their fraternal relationship wtf<end>
<start>sunny end of work i see him more as god of destiny than as god of shadow<end>
<start>we know that his domain is not physical and that even in the nightmares bit was afraid that he could hear but that is all we know about his domain<end>
<start>it would be more like it existed before but the exit leg makes it easier<end>
<start>sunny vs lord of shadows<end>
<start>sono nawa shadow<end>
<start>we may have the right to meet master sunless and lord of shadows<end>
<start>a limit she wonders if there is a connection between them ok but to think it is the same person nan<end>
<start>yeah but no we are going to avoid words like this even if you censor her thanks<end>
<start>bah it is the evolution of the capa of the saints it allowed to open a temporary door from the dream kingdom while i think it opens a permanent door or something<end>
<start>i think his lie has his contract with webnovel look when he took days off a few months ago he had when even managed to make advance chapters for the posts during his vac<end>
<start>nothing<end>
<start>but the effie can be<end>
<start>she mextermines every time<end>
<start>and again the part increase at all times it can do it on other people a bit like nephis who can now treat her close allies if she has a strong connection with them<end>
<start>is what sunny will happen in hot or cold water<end>
<start>the one and only<end>
<start>in any case we remain holy in spirit here no ship rain cest bizzare and c mal<end>
<start>what supremacy<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmy-bad-floyd-jackson-house-of-payne-my-fault-sorry-gif-<end>
<start>and then they can move forward<end>
<start>so snow is right<end>
<start>yes very possible that there is not even this function on the weapon and that it is just a perfectly adapted sword<end>
<start>okay thanks<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewtoe-dip-cold-pool-gif-<end>
<start>the only one that would be dangerous is asterion<end>
<start>nothing is impossible<end>
<start>spit<end>
<start>they had what age on the shore forget they were young so we can classify it as a youth error<end>
<start>oriiiiiii had forgotten that<end>
<start>not false not false<end>
<start>and deep down that is what you find really frustrating not changing pov<end>
<start>because let us imagine on the island of aletheia if he had released the fragment at the last revolution and the island was destroyed it would destroy the fragment or it leaves intact in the radius if this is the first case there is a way that it will at the same time fragment<end>
<start>i felt so much like it was not for nothing but at the same time it would make no sense that cassie was tied to the creation of the sortlege<end>
<start>cassia top animepray<end>
<start>she would have property like weaver's needle or something<end>
<start>for me the exit leg is like an anti-god defense system just forgets<end>
<start>i think that is exactly what he was saying<end>
<start>nothing can stop them<end>
<start>good for me the end of the volume is better than the volume yes i say sscassiepopcorn<end>
<start>efficates in all its hutaosigh splendor<end>
<start>perfect all this my theory on the effects of the fateless sunny on the vision of cassia was correct<end>
<start>i do not know but on g it is crazy to get there<end>
<start>but if there is the cohort<end>
<start>at least it is funny<end>
<start>i think she knows in advance if he will agree to go to the estuary or not<end>
<start>no big deal he is doing it again<end>
<start>but i do not think it is a divine rank or the key component of a seal of corruption so<end>
<start>she really thought it might go with neph shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>but it still has elements of the line of the shadow like dance or appearance<end>
<start>it looks like he hated sunny tllmt he comforted c abuse mdrr<end>
<start>impure titan and daemon<end>
<start>cheater<end>
<start>you think that is who effie wants to set up sunny<end>
<start>thank you the th<end>
<start>the<end>
<start>a tip goes on the reddit of super theory down there<end>
<start>welcome to the echo confrerie<end>
<start>i do not even want to get to her you blind bastard<end>
<start>i think his also seen the name of the volume when even mdr the tombs of ariel for me has meaning<end>
<start>but there is no god of oblivion<end>
<start>well but i got back to the chap just before so i had my stock of chap catscreen bah i am back waiting x<end>
<start>yes but i think his better when his recovery is good given that every killer snake gives him gas<end>
<start>when he looked for the seed leading to the kingdom of hop it was before he abandoned it<end>
<start>in english they have bcp in advance<end>
<start>well basically he will be able to consume it<end>
<start>like that big total reading<end>
<start>he will not try that much if it is that<end>
<start>then i keep thinking it would not go to neph<end>
<start>his freedom will cost him extremely dear<end>
<start>exactly nan<end>
<start>vasy i am going to believe you but you just looked firm at that reading<end>
<start>but will til or even weaver type raisins often<end>
<start>i just have the time to rewrite it well developed but i will have to end the nightmare once we get a max of information<end>
<start>i thought it was weird too<end>
<start>i love too much snake he will not die i know<end>
<start>or sunny kills him and basta<end>
<start>i do not know i cannot find the comparison<end>
<start>i admit i do not know what you were expecting from the rod attack so i did not get the same feeling since i was expecting nothing and i was not especially seeing him<end>
<start>or maybe they just do not<end>
<start>well i read something else funny<end>
<start>there is a different line aspect<end>
<start>anyway i just hope that at some point they will fight together<end>
<start>frr he is always at the restaurant<end>
<start>when i was volume<end>
<start>change your nick vile creation<end>
<start>oopsi<end>
<start>but sometimes i felt a little limp that even the author forgot that it was that sunny<end>
<start>yes it seems to me<end>
<start>no great fight has its assets<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewsherlock-benedictcumberbatch-watson-martinfreeman-gif-<end>
<start>i do not think it has anything to do with the shadow god<end>
<start>personal i have classed it top of the work<end>
<start>and he is a titan nan<end>
<start>bah dcp the theory i do not understand because there is no connection between asterion and kai<end>
<start>jcrois guys i go crazy<end>
<start>with his transcendent ability he can kind of multiply you add that to the fact that when he owns someone he keeps his aspectsmemories the guy is an entire cohort all alone<end>
<start>there is at least him and neph<end>
<start>it depends until g pushes history<end>
<start>shut up and stop teasing readers who are not up to date it also applies to those who are up to date<end>
<start>it happens often<end>
<start>yeah i see but if he could get along with himself he would be a very good duo i think<end>
<start>we do not know because the mask exists<end>
<start>by contrast theory zero lantern is the complete domain of shadow but sunny can not the recovery for the moment when the time has come the rank of lantern evoluera<end>
<start>after i am far from being on i did not understand everything either<end>
<start>that is because i dreamed your identity without doing it expres<end>
<start>for a while more mdr<end>
<start>but this is for now<end>
<start>she can just disappear what<end>
<start>nan ba dcp me too i wonder<end>
<start>i understood as sunny had the sense of active shadow and he took infinite when he arrived in psq city there was too many people in the range of the dark sense<end>
<start>noctis is therefore potentially not dead at the time he even told him that he was ready to take a walk with weaver before liberating hope we also know that he was a sorcerer after the events of the nd nightmare he could become a priest of the sortlege see even perhaps one of the great priests<end>
<start>a zombie survival bow with jet on the boat<end>
<start>i would be up to date for the recovery is carrer xd<end>
<start>especially as the nightmare tower was older and in better quality than the one sunny found<end>
<start>i do not know how much the exact number is<end>
<start>but it will not be sunny lman with whom they fought on the shore forgets etc<end>
<start>we will remember the romance nephis caster<end>
<start>ajd<end>
<start>yeah but there is something about fate chui about just not formulating it like his<end>
<start>yeah well those shadows will be stronger too<end>
<start>and then rereading the nightmares right now<end>
<start>it will be both in my opinion<end>
<start>but then we did not talk about it but the transfo sine of cass would not it be a rarignee<end>
<start>yes but the other awakens need fragments to advance it can convert everything into memories<end>
<start>or it will compromise his trade<end>
<start>so the house of the night chose a camp<end>
<start>yeah i thought they had at least the effects<end>
<start>if sunny could have eaten it is that weaver left something behind<end>
<start>technically it is possible that he just goes back to his bodies x<end>
<start>for me it is not the reason but there must be one more than the others<end>
<start>you know when the sequel will come out<end>
<start>has two fingers to leave fc neph<end>
<start>i think i am a top guy but not a row of fools either<end>
<start>siiiiiiii<end>
<start>summy<end>
<start>well if it is to set on the powers of the tormentor it is not a bad focus on the mental control and the memory of what i understood may be an extension of its sharing of senses but to verify and see<end>
<start>yeah but he lost all his memories<end>
<start>the changes to follow the adventures of groove with everything that happens next door does not tumblet<end>
<start>but the existence of the kingdom of dreams shows that the seal does not well its taff brother<end>
<start>it is really too good<end>
<start>it makes me feel better<end>
<start>the he is at the command of that song but she leaves him free so it is okay<end>
<start>this message makes me believe it<end>
<start>it is too sad<end>

<start>it shows quite clearly that sunny goes to the estuary no matter what<end>
<start>att i will break you<end>
<start>that is strongly implied in any case<end>
<start>he is too dark sasuke sunny<end>

<start>i am not going to say anything more the emoji is enough for himself<end>
<start>a wall of some day xd<end>
<start>who was waiting for that there were people who had theorized it<end>
<start>so it happens he is taken possession of the skin walker for a long time<end>
<start>on days he practically does not agree rest except when he finishes a volume alongside his all that encompasses his research and inspi for his work served one can say that seen the consistency of the chapters he did not have the incredible area but lean on a full year for my part i find that his an incredible amount of work<end>
<start>the attribute is not bound to its rank<end>
<start>future sunny in the estuary and sunny in the nightmare could cross<end>
<start>well it was not for ajd<end>
<start>which is already pretty much you want to type with the rock<end>
<start>a day<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewamalie-steiness-borregaard-loading-gif-loading-gif-<end>
<start>especially that once again he is not alone in his gale he has neph who takes the same path as he and groove that he helps with this method<end>
<start>i want to fuck my head against the wall on the chapter<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>it is going to be a messy lice with a paw in it to assieger rod cbpray<end>
<start>i mean i am rej sah<end>
<start>possible after sunny it really is the pro to do several things at once especially mtn<end>
<start>and no quality<end>
<start>queen<end>
<start>he already uses gas storage for his utility memories genre refrigerator go enchant jet then<end>
<start>g do not often leave details for nothing so i was wondering pk the titan arrives and he hides his eye to not look at the moon<end>
<start>what is on your top in this volume<end>
<start>kai does not deserve death but he is the one who is most likely to die<end>
<start>in real chui agree but then how the sortlege does to infect the world<end>
<start>for you what is the best bow<end>
<start>valor anvil chap in action omgggggggg cest shocking<end>
<start>decidedly tristan g pleases himself<end>
<start>he does not know who wins the war<end>
<start>yes but it seemed to me that he was following the author's rhythm<end>
<start>the nephissunny relationship has been present for a while but the author must take advantage of this moment of transition to develop it<end>
<start>yes<end>
<start>this is my cohort fav<end>
<start>like the memory of ice he had before<end>
<start>on the other hand i do not understand how mordret could have gone as far as the citadel of sunny a godgrave but could not find the citadel that is currently closest to the forces of song it seemed to me that mordret was able to move into a mirror world or he was safe thanks if someone had an answer<end>
<start>after it was not schizophrenia but<end>
<start>by the way tomorrow we are probably going to have a change of pov a pov groove would no longer bring anything<end>
<start>i do not see the appearance of a master evolute in divine<end>
<start>they just forget everything that is connected to sunless like everyone knew him before the bird stole him<end>
<start>i am telling you i forgot that sounds weird<end>
<start>thin<end>
<start>i squeak and do not read your messages by risk of spoiling me but i love this kind of title in slave shadow<end>
<start>it depends if it spoils me<end>
<start>i rage well at the beginning but after reading the chapter of the volume its calmer i see or author wants us in mens take your evil in patience you will see<end>
<start>holy aka<end>
<start>ah nan but he is coming back co-existing with other humans it is okay like normal<end>
<start>i do not think it is useful to modulate the shape for me it would not fit in the nephis style but then i can be wrong<end>
<start>i am<end>
<start>we have to see how to throw so bad a stomach pain when he found his body<end>
<start>we remember lepoque or there was only peepocrywhy<end>
<start>pikawow naan pk his finish like this<end>
<start>seeing what will not look<end>
<start>well we know that<end>
<start>if only effie was not a debile outside<end>
<start>and he got it like that<end>
<start>i am coming friends<end>
<start>i have got try hard<end>
<start>i am a member of only one church<end>
<start>in real sunny it can do as the supreme of valor not with the nude of epee if it frees from shadows and turns them into epee<end>
<start>a little weird<end>
<start>otherwise i return to farm my primos i have fulfilled my mission to embeter gray with ss i can return to my stream tranquillou adios friends<end>
<start>shibalaugh weaver created fate chuck norris controle<end>
<start>so if he comes out of his slavery it is just by cutting him<end>
<start>but it is still cool to have done it<end>
<start>it will happen in jamaica<end>
<start>maybe<end>
<start>on groove or bitrate<end>
<start>yeah that is pretty much it<end>
<start>he has his shadows anyway<end>
<start>i thought about another unlikely thing<end>
<start>c not the nightmare<end>
<start>no he is one of the sleepers i was seeing on the ss wiki but i think you misunderstood she is awake and not a master<end>
<start>the volume should soon end in my opinion after the volume will be on the war between song and valor perhaps after<end>
<start>it will be sublime<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwill-smith-gif-<end>
<start>so killing a character is not wise<end>
<start>it is marked in the title chapter<end>
<start>he needs to figure out how to evolve<end>
<start>shit shit so long as he does not recover his destiny or find no way to show his existence to the cohort she will not recognize his existence until he recovers his destiny<end>
<start>so it is bird also named kfc on the g-serv who broke the sons of his destiny so how his life<end>
<start>but nobody thinks he is laughing<end>
<start>i think they are well aware huh<end>
<start>i do not know why it would be an illusion<end>
<start>corruption is he who escapes a little<end>
<start>i am on the other hand it is not here to say it but in my mp<end>
<start>i do not think so yet either i do not understand the sunny decision<end>
<start>i think we have to wait but the moon may have another importance reminder you obel had said that the first cases of the exitlege in the world awakened on the moon its forcely important after what way its i did not in its<end>
<start>it is all the best<end>
<start>tyris has kept its shape from the days of the daffilee<end>
<start>i have made rules to respect them<end>
<start>but sunny told him mm the seal is imperfect but tjr very powerful<end>
<start>a less than the sortlege connects to her at the time of her elf<end>
<start>supercrygenk<end>
<start>it was not broken<end>
<start>shadow bah the echo just dies i think<end>
<start>it is pure madness i have had my skull<end>
<start>but wtf<end>
<start>on<end>
<start>yeah but he does not have enough strength<end>
<start>one of the sleepers that sunny and nephis we rescued<end>
<start>honestly i do not know who we were talking to about the moon and asterion but gg to him he had done a great theory on that if qqun finds the conv i am a taker<end>
<start>one learns his past but nothing of why of how etc<end>
<start>but the more i think about it the more i think his power is too smoking mdrr<end>
<start>it is clear if it is weaver who weaves fate or he can just see it<end>
<start>nor in the kind of consolation sin or its new armor which had it by killing the terror of the lo<end>
<start>or if he died<end>
<start>then we are not even sure it is really weaver who created the exit leg if<end>
<start>that weaver in covenant with the god of shadow<end>
<start>neph jla do not know how to die before the last bow<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewconor-mcgregor-ufc-fighter-in-cage-mma-gif-<end>
<start>so i trust the ability of sunny to create memories but to copy it an enchantment of this magnitude i am not on<end>
<start>each his rhythm<end>
<start>in truth i see the most probable theory for the end of this nightmare<end>
<start>even if you have the answers x<end>
<start>after writing a chapter is much less long than drawing pages<end>
<start>i am hot if we throw a cassie church<end>
<start>or they give up big poops like effie and kai<end>
<start>i did not see<end>
<start>having regard to the ptdrrrrrr locations at the same time<end>
<start>chaps it is so great especially on arc climax x<end>
<start>no<end>
<start>bah explains<end>
<start>oh her mother<end>
<start>but you are going to kick<end>
<start>it is normal with him<end>
<start>if there was nothing there was nothing to tell<end>
<start>theory<end>
<start>really not already master it is made one shot against saint if he takes a full whip then sovereign in his domain<end>
<start>since the beginning it is defined as the most mysterious the most terrifying of the sovereigns<end>
<start>yes logical but sunny has no reason to tell him the truth<end>
<start>i have so much crazy theory in my head<end>
<start>yeah i thought it was an official translation<end>
<start>uh no i do not believe the skys differ because it is different realms and so with different environments and different skys<end>
<start>an ultimate weapon against which the god forgets<end>
<start>i think i was really too tired when i read the chap<end>
<start>well you said none of them had snakes<end>
<start>tonight normally<end>
<start>that is normal she does not have a way out<end>
<start>possible in real life it would be interesting anyway<end>
<start>months after i get<end>
<start>i am wrong<end>
<start>yeah but before he entered the estuary he went in a boat<end>
<start>nan i mean he did not give a snake to a groove<end>
<start>there is always stronger<end>
<start>but it would be really hot<end>
<start>the only good thing is that sunny is going to go solo no limit<end>
<start>okay thanks guys<end>
<start>because if it is connected to sunny in tps reel bizzare as expression in the tomb of ariel it is a terror transcendent to the present time snake<end>
<start>a that is true<end>
<start>god forgets<end>
<start>best persono imp<end>
<start>in real life i do not think she is really impale is just for the shibalaugh aesthetics<end>
<start>she does not say anything<end>
<start>i have seen a theory that mordret would control the noctambul<end>
<start>he is got to make a memory i swear<end>
<start>except that the she of the first fact does not refer to the beast<end>
<start>why because he was not smart<end>
<start>chap appearance of goliath a fs i saw no mention<end>
<start>marry princess of nothing<end>
<start>i honestly think neph goes up his father in v<end>
<start>as sunny was with her it must be even more vague<end>
<start>but i understand how you feel<end>
<start>but the fact that he may have been encompassing the whole moon in his field seems to me plable<end>
<start>more than cassy anyway<end>
<start>no g confirm it in questions answer a person who did not come out of the nightmare cannot trust a nightmare<end>
<start>yes it is possible too<end>
<start>thank you gray for the chap but leave us on his what the author wants us to do wrong<end>
<start>yeah to see even if so much out of the dream domain we cannot get confirmation<end>
<start>and expressing my opinion<end>
<start>ahh dacc<end>
<start>the default of sunny it is of meche with cassia shibalaugh<end>
<start>i will make it<end>
<start>everything is said in due course<end>
<start>ha if exact thank you<end>
<start>i am spoiling<end>
<start>to forge the sword he needs to observe it and his memory the crown to increase the effectiveness of the memories and thus create a better epee<end>
<start>with only one memory<end>
<start>or death fun<end>
<start>it will not spoil<end>
<start>so i am reading again and not up to date so maybe what i do not understand what you mean but blood weaving and bone weaving are two parts of the weaver line<end>
<start>ah i was thinking after i think he is right<end>
<start>despite the fact that at the bottom she did not want sunny to leave<end>
<start>that is how much she is already in the volume<end>
<start>i look forward to the next ch<end>
<start>if the domain is limited to the citadel it has<end>
<start>we could have it in the form of a flashback with a groove that tells everything to sunny in person but further<end>
<start>cheh<end>
<start>a trio of cockroaches<end>
<start>he just said he is been with him a long time<end>
<start>you do not realize how powerful a superior titan can be<end>
<start>the real slavic shadow man is biting<end>
<start>oh good mdrr why that<end>
<start>i think that if she wakes up and then comes out of the dream world she becomes infected by the exit leg but without going through the nightmare<end>
<start>like it can affect the shadows<end>
<start>do not forget you are only the first when i am the best<end>
<start>read faster shibalaugh<end>
<start>i was thinking a cockroach weapon at the personal time<end>
<start>mordret and jet is temporary additions<end>
<start>so great max of the cursed<end>
<start>you go out<end>
<start>copying all the elements that sunny took is really cheap<end>
<start>in my head she has her usual visions but none will realize as she saw it or hoped it would<end>
<start>always the screenshots under the hand<end>
<start>but it is like shade on the ground<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmister-v-caa-do-many-lcanon-gif-<end>
<start>if i said so<end>
<start>the arrival of a sovereign like this from the bridge between reality and the rdr the week has been long-story<end>
<start>so in real life it is possible what just forgot<end>
<start>we got a description of the bitter aspect if<end>
<start>but it is weird that to become saint sunny has lost her destiny<end>
<start>well then it is for today or for tomorrow its eve<end>
<start>but in fact being given that sunny has lost the divine line of shadow i see him well gets a new taste dichor and the gift has groove so that she has the line<end>
<start>kai on top for me with luck he has one shot or just he steals and the machine gun and immobilizes it with his orders<end>
<start>chapter sunny gets rid of the sin of loneliness is really a demonstration of the genie of g i am on the ass this author is really too strong which genie what mastery of his work what imagination bordereelll<end>
<start>it is only to the questions that he cannot answer by lying by message maybe<end>
<start>fan lice<end>
<start>no<end>
<start>i do not know if i am going to let you have a plan so it would not surprise me if it ended up bad between the two too<end>
<start>i am going to the wind or the wind<end>
<start>i see it more like the dasterion that is not vrm on the physical plane<end>
<start>and even a beach episode with nephis<end>
<start>ptet is the tannery of a tyrant superior<end>
<start>we are having fun<end>
<start>he killed a superior beast<end>
<start>are possible<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrr<end>
<start>effie ii<end>
<start>most beautiful saint looks younger maybe<end>
<start>in any case i was afraid at the start for the post elipse arch but it is probably the one with my favorite start between the internal pov changes of the characters and the romance between nephis and sunny that explodes without having a rival to the con<end>
<start>with doors<end>
<start>but at any time i am in a hole<end>
<start>t es to which chapters<end>
<start>in real life it is possible by knowing the sortlege<end>
<start>change your nickname<end>
<start>i do not think it will be in fashion yeah you will never be a slave again<end>
<start>i do not think that is it<end>
<start>i am hit by events<end>
<start>we will not have a direct pov jpense but they will probably tell the story at some point or another<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>and it would fit<end>
<start>it keeps one of the two i think<end>
<start>and he lived so much in his life that i think he can afford it<end>
<start>years ago<end>
<start>his will be sarigole<end>
<start>it is beautiful what is going on i am having fun like a crazy pout<end>
<start>yeah but cassie could go through for example she knew to caster<end>
<start>so yes<end>
<start>it is always been shibalaugh there is only to see it is shadow if they reflect its main features of character in two that do not go<end>
<start>like if jte puts in a cellar during and say<end>
<start>where you are allowing yourself to withdraw the punishment from that stupid snow<end>
<start>jthinks mm<end>
<start>yen is too confusing<end>
<start>it is all the time called perfid etc since the beginning<end>
<start>it tells me something<end>
<start>the fact that weaver's birds stole the destiny of sunny i find her nice<end>
<start>we were rolled in the flour<end>
<start>well people think she is crazy<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewalvin-and-the-chipmunks-alvin-whoops-my-bad-oops-gif-<end>
<start>and the coincidences that exist<end>
<start>bah in real life he probably uses three sunny since he has to strengthen himself<end>
<start>i have got another pepet to read<end>
<start>okay thanks<end>
<start>sunny who sinks a corrupt titan really the most powerful saint of the game<end>
<start>it is a little dishonest in real life knowing that it might have been enough to make him change his mind<end>
<start>see maybe huh<end>
<start>i am going to read but i feel something<end>
<start>only this<end>
<start>thanks man<end>
<start>yeah i guess mdrr<end>
<start>here it works less well<end>
<start>you are the goat you think you are sah<end>
<start>as he says himself his only experience with a chick nephis is to spend a month on a geezing turtle shibalaugh<end>
<start>saint<end>
<start>the latest news for the general public<end>
<start>i am rereading my archives i said the bird thief was minimal a cursed tyrant i was pretty good<end>
<start>rain that does not understand why sunny is afraid of mirrors i am dead<end>
<start>soon and always as much quality<end>
<start>bite to explain his fight<end>
<start>stop smoking<end>
<start>and she realizes that the the is cold<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewjjk-gojo-gif-<end>
<start>that is for sure<end>
<start>yes i understood<end>
<start>bah fielon has more potential than saint<end>
<start>yes so how its fact that weaver is born from the god of dreams while creating it<end>
<start>but in real life a good candidate to be of the temple line he seems to be of a good family with a saint as uncle<end>
<start>we must be able to find this when sunny explains the new things in the world at the beginning of the volume<end>
<start>i love this bow too much it makes reflect every chapter ahah<end>
<start>the end is hilarious<end>
<start>if they ever bond<end>
<start>boss<end>
<start>it is the solstice<end>
<start>honestly he needs a cohort so much it is sad to say but as long as he does not do the same it is true<end>
<start>we talk about people especially anvil who do not think that the girl they tried to murder when she was little and in her first nightmare and do not they rotted life as well as drove their servant away without helping her could potentially blame them<end>
<start>that<end>
<start>c not false mdr<end>
<start>but yeah that explains why he is a dreamy being i forgot that passage<end>
<start>need a rebalancing of global levels to give a sunny a bit of difficulty<end>
<start>nan i had misinterpreted the sentence<end>
<start>it is finally done in the last three messages of the channel you have got ping it is guys reporting mistakes and we are saying it is not the right channel shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>i am back in full of fun passages that i forgot<end>
<start>it will not get me mad at any hutaooo thing<end>
<start>oh okay thanks grandpa<end>
<start>if she dies i will be both gutted and too happy because i have been calling him for a long time<end>
<start>the best idea in the world<end>
<start>it can use its appearance during combat<end>
<start>to locate me<end>
<start>but you cannot force him to learn cassie<end>
<start>almost<end>
<start>caster nan and he was a heir<end>
<start>understanding we all want to see it but i do not see it spawn mtn<end>
<start>we do not want people's birthday from nowhere like this<end>
<start>the other is the god of the dead birth cycle<end>
<start>then steal the queen's<end>
<start>blud thinks to be amon<end>
<start>i have the right mwa<end>
<start>i have too much soum i prefer the transfo i had thought about<end>
<start>snake like so great scattering it is a reward so good<end>
<start>yes c possible<end>
<start>i mean it really looks good<end>
<start>no jcrois not<end>
<start>tkt will get worse<end>
<start>i really hate you catscreen<end>
<start>i think so holy cane it is in a fight in the hollow mountains especially that ya bcq of lore not developed around it for example with its class change all specific has an object of the rdr and we know tjr not pk<end>
<start>with the crown may be<end>
<start>a what chapter<end>
<start>especially will the effie child be a sovereign<end>
<start>breaking news in addition to trying to assassinate the changing star of the heirs of the great song clan murdered the young sunless knight this young master who helped the inhabitants of bastion by maintaining charitable work as well as playful scene was silenced by the infamous subfifre queen of towards the great valor clan in support with the young princess decided to punish the great song clan by declaring to them the war<end>
<start>it is really not agreeable to arrive a day but after the doors of this living room open to you and you can react every day that is pretty cool in real life<end>
<start>rather<end>
<start>and yes there is anvil for valor<end>
<start>an opinion on<end>
<start>it is not that big a godgrave<end>
<start>i am for<end>
<start>as it was in relation to slavic shadow i said it was better here<end>
<start>since the main problem is that the world gets swallowed up by the dream god<end>
<start>i forgot the name<end>
<start>muahaha<end>
<start>that they pass alone<end>
<start>a little more<end>
<start>if at some point g reunites them on screen and leaves the sunny pov<end>
<start>you would have preferred someone else shibalaugh<end>
<start>beggining after the end<end>
<start>chief's surprise hop<end>
<start>i stay on my phoenix idea<end>
<start>the devastation that kai must do<end>
<start>he can access to supremacy via natural method as what neph does and from the clues he has drawn from his discussion with her he already has good bases with all the shadows in his sea of the soul and memories he can the custom-made creations and the bonds to his soul that is in itself more op<end>
<start>i hope at least that he said hello to the lover by the way<end>
<start>but i was wondering when even something is okay with the demon of oblivion but what the god in combination with<end>
<start>i am not talking anymore<end>
<start>seeing what is gone from mission to mission she probably forgot some stuff but ananke probably makes it so much so i would be hard to believe what just forgot<end>
<start>nobody trusts me<end>
<start>the best c is the nephellim of the shore forgets the<end>
<start>then yes and no<end>
<start>they do not understand when we put the evidence in front of them so we leave them alone<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwow-surprised-face-little-boss-gif-alisa-gif-<end>
<start>it is his weaving in the she will<end>
<start>actually it can come from the but it could also come from the lepoch or the gods lived with men and do not the line it transmitted<end>
<start>if it happens she will only have it in chap<end>
<start>we learn that when we are already<end>
<start>look at his real name shibalaugh<end>
<start>there is too much fight good to put it top<end>
<start>sunny nuclei serve to have shadows<end>
<start>because be every creature or person who left sunny for death he kills her after<end>
<start>even in the coms that is the question so i am not crazy<end>
<start>babysitting<end>
<start>it depends on you counting fake or not shibalaugh at least - i think shibalaugh<end>
<start>the song he sings is this one<end>
<start>basically to defeat the creation he said his real name and bitert saw the scene<end>
<start>he killed the superior demon and recovered the citadel<end>
<start>well it is telling when the ellipse happens so if<end>
<start>thank you<end>
<start>because asterion supreme should have created one then<end>
<start>yup i really understand crazy me the volume prince of nothing i found him crazy thanks to him sah<end>
<start>and the ebene tower is more nether<end>
<start>i am mostly waiting for the moment when he is going to find what is left of the shadow kingdom<end>
<start>i think to go back up it is like neph or mortret is enough of redo<end>
<start>oe but better<end>
<start>for me it seems too simple<end>
<start>yes but from the to that that groove is facing a shadow<end>
<start>in real life i saved the theory just in case<end>
<start>kai already told us about his parents<end>
<start>during the months of solo life<end>
<start>so we would have seen the meeting if there was one<end>
<start>perfect<end>
<start>and arch<end>
<start>sunny's got it right<end>
<start>after as a groove is infected by the exitlege she may have a different condition from the old awakens<end>
<start>while we know that a nightmare already starts it is impossible to get in from inside so be the tomb fucks this rule be all the nightmares happening in its connection from near or far allowing some person to leave a trace<end>
<start>a titan superior<end>
<start>the coup of the involvement of the demon of forgetfulness is more a personal interpretation<end>
<start>tower of ebene the tower of nether there was a map which was more than one place do not not a pyramid<end>
<start>ptdrrr no<end>
<start>you mean noctis<end>
<start>i am glad i shot the damned tyrant<end>
<start>rain will be our guinea pig<end>
<start>no spoil of the last chaps o jiji is not a day<end>
<start>normally not<end>
<start>but really in addition it is one of his best tricks to increase his personal power with the control of the essence his recovery etc even if as holy jsp if it really changes something to his control of the essence<end>
<start>sovereigns literally defie the laws of the world<end>
<start>but there is no need to go back in there<end>
<start>so she intended to get back in touch and fight at her side<end>
<start>bad living room<end>
<start>thank you for all the gray chaps<end>
<start>let us not abuse her either i would not be surprised that everything that happened to sunny was wanted by weaver<end>
<start>in the first place of the exit leg of the nightmare<end>
<start>i think she wakes up like a dark soul boss<end>
<start>like a soda cohort of saints that emerges from a supernatural nightmare with crazy memories etc<end>
<start>oki mea culpa<end>
<start>i feel like he lost everything<end>
<start>well she does not want to<end>
<start>the cohort in itself as ascendants are already above all kinds they are really too strong as a saint if they return to the same temporal place it will be worse they will be far too strong<end>
<start>blud managed to make a child effie he deserves it well<end>
<start>there is a great chance that the where i am we do not know everything about him yet and that he is clearly going to evolve too in the middle of the lore it is going to be genial with mordret<end>
<start>you read them in advance<end>
<start>that too we cannot know at any time you have an area or being unclean is the basis to survive<end>
<start>nhelshetane<end>
<start>it works thanks<end>
<start>so basically a ruler like a tyrant for the creations of the nightmare must have servants or lands to become more powerful<end>
<start>cassie who always monitors them<end>
<start>do not forget he was worried about his first nightmare before<end>
<start>yess bah i try to finish ajd her if i have time i wanted to finish yesterday but good shibalaugh<end>
<start>all explained<end>
<start>the or it gives test to pass it has a certain rule to hold or it must be just in the test it gives<end>
<start>honesty<end>
<start>you can even say that it is part of destiny that happens to him especially if he still has fun eating pieces of divinity<end>
<start>if a kernel shadow so it loses a nucleus as in the same nightmare<end>
<start>there is a world or it is worse<end>
<start>bah only the affinity with the shadow had to count so i think<end>
<start>to see how he manages the restoration of the relationships of the characters<end>
<start>laugh<end>
<start>but he would have had the kick from the beginning and now that he is very strong he does not need it anymore so we remove the limit and he progresses further that is a bit like that i see him<end>
<start>he was not supreme he said it himself and until he proved otherwise he is the most honest of the two worlds even<end>
<start>i am not sure<end>
<start>yeah but every time he gets a detruct sunny loses a row<end>
<start>and so sunny would not get what he wants<end>
<start>i have got some fine bug shibalaugh<end>
<start>its dependence so creative take a lot of gasoline<end>
<start>i do not think it is a personal coincidence<end>
<start>no it can just more be infected the exitlege is even squarely practical it is not for nothing that he has created his mini pocket outleg shibalaugh<end>
<start>personal if i were to make a top of the people i saw the most die it would be<end>
<start>it is the only one that exists<end>
<start>yes of course<end>
<start>what do i say squarely it is raye from the existence of destiny<end>
<start>a sunny and his dreams of freedom<end>
<start>yes i am clearly a little bit maybe not even a little bad times but cassie was not really honest with him either<end>
<start>young girl when she was even<end>
<start>there is not too much debate i think<end>
<start>it must be a vision of the future that had and could have happened<end>
<start>it is got to come from the fact that he does not want the release to decide for her<end>
<start>i cannot say otherwise<end>
<start>it is not spammable that<end>
<start>loser<end>
<start>he must have a batcave<end>
<start>i say nothing more read<end>
<start>well i have a theory so the professor obel said that the doors can be opened according to the people who wake up and not the opposite and during the battle of the black skull there was a door of lvl and one remembers that the teacher obel also said that the doors can open in time before mm that there is an eveil example with the door of lvl that opened before the rise of the first supremium so i think that the doors lvl are the doors of sunny nephis and bite is the saint with divine aspect that defeated the same nightmare there could only have been doors because only those with divine aspects created doors of this level so the theorie asterion would surely have a divine aspect because there was only one door of lvl and not three and asterion is the most mysterious and probably the most powerful so it seems logical to me<end>
<start>she is untouchable if she wants to<end>
<start>if not simple prop to avoid head plugs with a chp deck the publication will always work out of lapsus<end>
<start>honestly that would not even hurt<end>
<start>the infinite evolution stuff i do not believe in is nothing that makes sunny have this thing<end>
<start>divine line does not necessarily mean divine aspect<end>
<start>it is totally that<end>
<start>but i really cannot imagine what<end>
<start>in space i did not remember that<end>
<start>we got bcq info on the fields the i digeste and i make a rapprochement with tt the info we have on asterion because it is thanks to biting the domain we know best<end>
<start>and especially hate to see his transfo<end>
<start>sunny has her shadows that is enough<end>
<start>the transition as a guy's day is rough<end>
<start>jpense what the key to the return of sunny on the front of the stage will be<end>
<start>besides mtn sunny is probably the only person who can kill cassie extremely easily<end>
<start>you pay the site<end>
<start>you go visit another cellar after finishing trad ss<end>
<start>i knew it already<end>
<start>wsh<end>
<start>yess but it is from the end of volume<end>
<start>you travel in time<end>
<start>i did not realize he was not up to date<end>
<start>you feel like he is got a cyou are a g shibalaugh<end>
<start>yeah but before he broke it he had one<end>
<start>it shockes no one as a master like sunny who is a little above average in the collective imagination is the strongest master in history jpense<end>
<start>must be prevented<end>
<start>he participates in all the shibalaugh camps<end>
<start>for others it never exists<end>
<start>yeah i hate the next few volumes what<end>
<start>the author would not have done his or her own but not with a random<end>
<start>chap when testing the capa<end>
<start>it is coming out of where it is<end>
<start>after in real life if he keeps his rhythm he is going to be years max<end>
<start>or then it would happen to create gas storage devices a bit like what they used in the tower on anemone<end>
<start>god of the cyou are of the souls of the emotions of growth and hunger i believe<end>
<start>in truth i prefer the devil of winter more than the devil of arctic<end>
<start>the only difference would reside in the gel aura she has<end>
<start>i am just thinking that i can catch up with trql and gray has a vacation x<end>
<start>but that yai different domains<end>
<start>well do not worry<end>
<start>i think he is going to get a failure<end>
<start>well it is not a big spoil but welp<end>
<start>so he replaced the mad prince of the pass<end>
<start>and the rest is just as amazing<end>
<start>i am going<end>
<start>after godgrave is more moving under the sun's sight<end>
<start>the deamon<end>
<start>it is going to be the most important piece of work<end>
<start>or in water or in america<end>
<start>so maybe i missed it maybe it was on the side road or maybe it was just a mistake<end>
<start>and can inflict damage to the soul a bit like jet<end>
<start>you put it on<end>
<start>not the right channel<end>
<start>especially that nephis is like intuable<end>
<start>source<end>
<start>on the other hand with all his stuff of nothing empty etc i would not be surprised if g got us something about light<end>
<start>i am protecting my city from the naughty you<end>
<start>a teacher<end>
<start>but i think it is no coincidence<end>
<start>yeah but when even if your friend holding a cafe not far from your house asks you to be part of a secret clan he is got himself founded because he is actually an ultra powerful saint<end>
<start>without the exitlegex he is going when i think i am going to move on<end>
<start>a sunnysolvan ptit in combat<end>
<start>and nephis against the panther<end>
<start>if i were from the valor clan and wanted to enjoy public opinion and enjoy motivating nephis to go to war i would have done that<end>
<start>jade not stone like a certain statue<end>
<start>ah oe deso<end>
<start>and i think there is a way that it has a different transfo corrupt than normal<end>
<start>about your theory i think it is bound to the two because the will subjects the universal laws in one sense and that snake can be not nullified but strongly restrained this will or just ignore it can lead to two different things either snake draw from the nature of shadow death or they can in the will of shadow that since it is the last to die it has a very strong will<end>
<start>it cannot just be that<end>
<start>i hope so<end>
<start>it is full time on it for a little while i believe over years it comes out chapter about ten pages about it pages you know authors able to release a book of pages every year it is just awesome and writing this is not something easy to find ideas reflect on history keeping your coherent world etc chapter a day it is really a lot especially that it tries to make them longer at the moment<end>
<start>fate<end>
<start>it is mostly to see the others in the cohort find it beautiful who amaze me they even being saints what makes me so funny to see but so pleasant to see their relationship so much progress and see nephis take the lead<end>
<start>you remember something tg forgot<end>
<start>but tomb of ariel is too much the peak of luvre is nothing to say again<end>
<start>against morgan<end>
<start>in my opinion they did not break their head they were directly looking for the one who produces the trad without worrying about who broadcasts it and how<end>
<start>well that is not his main purpose<end>
<start>but it seems so logical that i would not be surprised he said<end>
<start>he just forgot<end>
<start>it is rather a personal opinion but i think it would be better to refer to nothing like a concept and therefore not to put negations<end>
<start>i have a problem when i am on the chap and i press the next he sends me to<end>
<start>ah oe romance sacre<end>
<start>thank you for the chapters apugdance<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthriller-michael-jackson-eating-popcorn-watching-gif-<end>
<start>what is impossible<end>
<start>we had been told i no longer know or that asterion did not fight with the other sovereigns among others because it does not need the lands and people to become stronger my theory is that asterion collects the souls as sunny does with the shadows and we know how much these elements are bound so their domain will compete and its will as at the shore forgets or nephis took care of the gunlau and sunny of harus would do as if it was his sovereign to shoot down seen how nephis would be put forward against the others his would make a beautiful parallel<end>
<start>bah he is present as a beast and evil and that the real threat was his corruption as well as the six wounds no corruption thanks to nephis and no wounds thanks to the mad prince and the tormentor<end>
<start>i am more hype by this<end>
<start>with his teeth<end>
<start>so you are or you are<end>
<start>i am going far from crazy but suddenly if the seas of the soul can evolute then the kingdom of dreams and can be the sea of the soul of a divinity<end>
<start>in the cassia explains to sunny what was left a bed note saying to find a certain sunless with also the day of her anniv she could not leave him in the nightmare so he was necessarily in the real world or the world of dreams but not the nightmare what which means what was already aware of the decision that sunny was going to take in addition she explains to him what always wanted to create something that can destroy destiny while having completely forgotten sunny so reason cannot be the freedom of sunny<end>
<start>says you that during falcon scott goliath was the same level of alert as dusk<end>
<start>i am just asking that the writing of the women's most of all does not only revolve around their love relationship<end>
<start>i can see that she is dying because she knows too much<end>
<start>a noctis that recognizes sunny<end>
<start>if we are realistic<end>
<start>it is not the sortlege that chooses the capabilities<end>
<start>who is this monster<end>
<start>ahh but i speak in book<end>
<start>it is not the same thing<end>
<start>for he was raised by astrion that has the line of the god of the heart<end>
<start>give it to a fielon then<end>
<start>i like it<end>
<start>yes i see<end>
<start>and then that is why he cannot bring him out<end>
<start>if you start catching up there is a way to be synchronous with the end of the volume<end>
<start>go ahead and start directly<end>
<start>it is just too creative g<end>
<start>maybe one day he will make appear caster meh<end>
<start>i cry<end>
<start>a yes something that can corrupt anyone just by touching him that he was not in his best form thanks to the serpent king who had carried him a fatal blow<end>
<start>his na not yet been specified but it is thought that his after the war that the seeds of the nightmare appeared then after the war that the kingdom of dreams began to consume the other kingdoms one does not hear about godgrave before the volume and before that the great clan had not yet reached a real border then i will say that its during its years that it is discovered the zone<end>
<start>it is not necessarily a part i expected personally<end>
<start>sunny who always finds herself in the right place to break mouths<end>
<start>i claim this theory<end>
<start>but he had her in his very first nightmare<end>
<start>for groove maybe<end>
<start>and what i find totally disgusting is that they come to me as a translator instead of the people who are swaying the chapters illegitimately i do not want the moderation but a webnovel<end>
<start>it is years<end>
<start>chief<end>
<start>if it is the existence of sunny before exiting or after exiting lege that is erased<end>
<start>too much cheese for a sovereign<end>
<start>i do not think we got the news<end>
<start>i really think that there is no way for her to remember there is that cassie who can to some extent<end>
<start>jreste sur kai<end>
<start>you know it happens to you<end>
<start>since when is a curse<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewblague-valid-jdg-gif-<end>
<start>especially because sunny asked her not to tell her but stv<end>
<start>nan it is more a question of associating old names vo has names version gray or then some more or less comic phrase turns that can be misinterpreted by reading i dive into a french version more easily than in other languages<end>
<start>psq if you leave time running<end>
<start>guys just a question please is what sunless will have a moment of solitude pressure<end>
<start>mmh i do not know possible i have more details of chap xd but in real life i think that hollow mountains there will be a small excursion with neph and cassia which would be cool even if not all sutie<end>
<start>will have to wait until it is more dev<end>
<start>her simple hers during the volume every time you passed the chapter of the day her brought you back to the beginning of the volume here is why trauma<end>
<start>at this point the level revelation will be fine i think<end>
<start>on the other hand i wonder who between corrupt sunny saint and sunny saint is the most powerful<end>
<start>the principle of mystical strength is style it is a bit like breaking the laws of the world<end>
<start>i think the souverrain in general is like the center of the domain and that if it is in the domain of another sovereign it is in its domain<end>
<start>it should have been his most versatile and powerful weapon if we did not count the rank<end>
<start>what i have to imagine is a step back on the news what we have not got yet<end>
<start>that is the point<end>
<start>ananke yes but i do not think she is much wearing her mask during the trip<end>
<start>just i did not understand you mentioned the wrong person in the message<end>
<start>weaver the traitor has both daemons and gods that is ostracis<end>
<start>and even persos as anvil or cassy<end>
<start>he is got it<end>
<start>plus the adopted brother of the groove died in his first nightmare<end>
<start>it is not just a tattoo<end>
<start>that is how a good relationship starts<end>
<start>we had a fight against a horde and a fight against the hyvernal beast<end>
<start>after chap<end>
<start>he is going to get rid of the master slave relationship<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewso-bad-jokemaster-joke-hah-haha-gif-<end>
<start>he did not lose his real name he lost his destiny and consequently the whole exit leg with<end>
<start>pk<end>
<start>i had zape too<end>
<start>i saw the truth<end>
<start>man my info c eme nightmares and something ravenheart but vsy just keep the message and read it when t v<end>
<start>sunny he is got brain so she will go to godger<end>
<start>except if the person was already holy at the time of infection because the transfo is already defined<end>
<start>until sunny moves<end>
<start>his revelations should no longer walk on sunny<end>
<start>yeah that is for the base<end>
<start>we are going to stop the pcq is not the right living room and we are not showing any example<end>
<start>pq<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewyoudoit-dean-winchester-supernatural-you-gif-<end>
<start>especially period with falcon scott<end>
<start>if you are a terror with you again becoming a tyrant with me<end>
<start>me no more<end>
<start>like glass with sand<end>
<start>yes its on<end>
<start>and that is predictable<end>
<start>technically he has more shade line sunny<end>
<start>i wonder how the weaving of the soul will help him to power up his soul is stronger but concretely it means what<end>
<start>may be because he had it between arriving at the castle and when she gave him the endless spring<end>
<start>yeah but sunny pretends to be a person working at the back of the forehead<end>
<start>that is who your character prefers other than sunny well suare shibalaugh<end>
<start>sunny should gloat for every laugh or she is fucked up<end>
<start>i am the chair of the shadow biting sunny<end>
<start>be careful we do not have the right to post screenshots of site reviews<end>
<start>basically you say that sunny are domain would not use people and citadels but rather the dead in his sea of love i think someone had already theorized it and i find that his would make a parallel with asterion<end>
<start>i got a giga seum<end>
<start>just please if it is towards the end or the beginning so i can set a limit<end>
<start>the temple of the beginning of the work be like<end>
<start>beautiful deduction<end>
<start>no i do not think so<end>
<start>no more seriously the volume is my preferer because g has to regulate one of his defaults that is to say the pov of the different characters before he did it very little but the in volume he his lache makes more pov nephis and cassy but also with jeteffie and kai during their battle that jai finds very cool but for me the best his rest the pov rain certain will find that it was boring to follow her but i really jai kiffe all his pov but after ya the rest with the flash back of sunny the gold and romance neph and sunny for me there is everything that is necessary in volume voila sscassie dsl for the pave<end>
<start>we were nice but i had done a bit on the occasion<end>
<start>it will be clearer in future chaps<end>
<start>we are served for the next chaps<end>
<start>that is to say she is got fragments<end>
<start>i think so but i do not think so<end>
<start>and since the outcrop does nothing at random and godgrave is a more complicated area than the shore forgets it may mean that ray has more potential than sunny<end>
<start>which chapter<end>
<start>i wait tjr the eyes or the brain of weaver to bear sleekly or is my il on the mask of weaver<end>
<start>and in all cases holy is transcendent and nightmare is ascending<end>
<start>just watch your guy's valor knight<end>
<start>what time this<end>
<start>i do not really want g to come grab the gray jacket you see<end>
<start>i think the volume is my pref but it is not comparable vrm<end>
<start>exactly<end>
<start>yes his laugh<end>
<start>yeah that is the point<end>
<start>but there is only one thing left that he has created times his rank several times<end>
<start>plus she really thinks she never gave all the guns to sunny so he could get away with it for me it was just her destiny to go and it would not have changed her telling her<end>
<start>i had time<end>
<start>but yeah there must be some aspect that can see the enchantment<end>
<start>so we will know that sunny can become the goat without nephis having to remind her like a good toy<end>
<start>the joke really sucked<end>
<start>maybe you do not even need the next bow we do not know what is going on<end>
<start>it is bound to the souls<end>
<start>i think he is the center of his field<end>
<start>yeah i am talking about the two great priests<end>
<start>nah x<end>
<start>and even it does not work so ptit ling does not count<end>
<start>okay he is not standing anymore<end>
<start>yes so she already takes some place<end>
<start>god damn it i have got too much of his coming to him<end>
<start>corrupt terror highest if you do not count the egg<end>
<start>- pages<end>
<start>but he would have started reading for real<end>
<start>okay well then you will have to cimmer<end>
<start>we are all on the discord shibalaugh<end>
<start>there is a sting on the ananke coat that says why it always needs to be black or something like that<end>
<start>for me pyramid is the bow just before being supreme is too dangerous otherwise<end>
<start>sunny did not have to face di dechu in her age<end>
<start>not aspect heritage they depend directly on the logical sortlege in real life since it gives memories<end>
<start>if jlis chaps jpeux too much talking here is less funny<end>
<start>but he does what the naeve is talking about the shore sea forgets<end>
<start>he has a clan to give him mdr<end>
<start>i did not know chuck norris had anything to do with ss<end>
<start>oe but it is weaver that he weaves it would mean that he did expres to let sunny break it<end>
<start>there is a game tonight there is priorities in life laughs<end>
<start>we do not actually see everything<end>
<start>anvil comes from the first generation so it is not possible<end>
<start>cassie is too impossible<end>
<start>when you start the chapter<end>
<start>i do not think he can catch up and defeat the bird before he is at least hoarded<end>
<start>in real life the two chapters a day it goes above all that gray is pretty reguy on the time of release while when you wait for the chapters in english and g spells them a morning hours instead of the change of pov it is criminal yeah<end>
<start>margin<end>
<start>ct what date<end>
<start>therefore may be that the divine rank is precisely this ascension<end>
<start>for him<end>
<start>but a shared domain bof<end>
<start>at the beginning of the slice of life part<end>
<start>'end of the world real<end>
<start>and you stop wanting us to spoil you like everyone else read and make your own opinion the next time you want us to spoil you something i will transfer you<end>
<start>is dead he sent so many memories at once<end>
<start>sunny's sword<end>
<start>in another effigy world would have said uncle sunny<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewuh-hu-nodding-kitty-dinah-alice-in-wonderland-gif-<end>
<start>it is after weaver's drop dichor that sunny could do it<end>
<start>well i would not be up to date for the chapter release<end>
<start>he boiled a superior demon with a shadow so with the flakes i said it was at breakfast<end>
<start>that is who already tamar in the story<end>
<start>sunny vs titan dormant who wins<end>
<start>to stay rp<end>
<start>when you need hop swapping<end>
<start>the last big thing<end>
<start>jle say again but i like too much post ellipse chaps it is so good<end>
<start>divine attributes is another fucking level<end>
<start>after on kai c possible genre at the end of the work one has kai divine who steals the chicks from the world shibalaugh<end>
<start>uh<end>
<start>it is the chap pov it is ultra interesting<end>
<start>because you are talking about biting and his faults a little bit about the thing i wanted to know<end>
<start>easier to say than to do<end>
<start>i think it is too easy to just go to the fountain<end>
<start>preferably average for elite of the wake elite<end>
<start>like the first one to wash<end>
<start>nan swears<end>
<start>but that is actually the skin walker<end>
<start>ah bah ts already in x<end>
<start>but dcp if i do not nimp it will favor the theory of a forbidden line like weaver<end>
<start>without lying all the nephis chapter is suicide for sunny by telling her her real name because cassie had told her and now sunny is slavery of nephis<end>
<start>if she really wanted to put him in the shit and manipulate him she would not even have warned him of the consequences she would just say go to the estuary and you will be free here but her steps that she did<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewsniper-pubg-loading-sniper-reload-gif-<end>
<start>she helped her but i have got this bitter taste of her mystical<end>
<start>he also taught her the bow shot<end>
<start>you have seen her bad since the beginning<end>
<start>i know but like i am saying as a safe to be sure that rain does not die yes but not that she does nothing and snake kills the whole nightmare alone or that kind of thing<end>
<start>we were getting out of the larc with bitten jvou that he<end>
<start>not very logical as reasoning i find there are some possible eases - the time of the last cycle passed in the real world is about years - they come back instant because time is too strange in the nightmare to be taken into account in the real world - they come back very long after being returned<end>
<start>the most reloud is at the end of a volume<end>
<start>or at least she will have trouble remembering<end>
<start>very possible as it is in his shadow after she does not go physically so it is that a theory<end>
<start>the jdois finish game of thrones while basic i do not like everything that is seriesfilms all this to make a friend read<end>
<start>i have a theory would it not be likely that after their nightmares the cohort would return exactly to the same temporality that is to say at the time they interacted with the end of the pyramid to get into the nightmare<end>
<start>they already have their reason to declare war<end>
<start>he is a saint so he is even more beautiful<end>
<start>person has the chapter number by chance<end>
<start>just what to get infected<end>
<start>let us be realistic<end>
<start>so in big groin can become unlooking master but will not be able to access transcendence or it might never happen even if she gets one from here<end>
<start>do not give me ideas like that<end>
<start>i feel too much the field of sunny's shadow become the ability to invoke his weapon of shadow in his sea of soul tell me not i know not<end>
<start>it is done expres that the order of publication of the trad is the same as on the websitenovel and that there is suddenly chapters of delay<end>
<start>territorial model areas are cancelled but the concepts are still<end>
<start>and that she has tjrs surpassed sunny in pure v<end>
<start>jvoyais in the sense that the domain of one is also that of the other<end>
<start>as to nightmare i did not understand whether the subjugated nightmares become creations of the nightmare under his command or whether it is more like fragments for the awakens that they strengthen the horse<end>
<start>he was in another place and seeing that he was born no longer the sortlege it would be enough that sunny could have more information<end>
<start>the masterclasses of<end>
<start>the citadel in the dark with the shadow fragment<end>
<start>she could have prevented him from the consequences<end>
<start>sunny probably does not<end>
<start>well so a little because it does not happen to be she does not get away<end>
<start>i watched a cursed terror<end>
<start>may be real<end>
<start>in my humble opinion superior<end>
<start>there is a debate<end>
<start>i thought it was to create another snake<end>
<start>to tell if a nightmare creation obviously breaks everything<end>
<start>it will add a little tensionemotion<end>
<start>death of ananke<end>
<start>i will give it back to you later<end>
<start>he came back to the shore forgets when<end>
<start>she knows he was there but does not know who exactly<end>
<start>in real the beginning with gunlaug jai plus his name but you have understood it looks a bit like what neph wants to do to the sovereign to beat the release<end>
<start>domain all i understood is that when you are in your domain you are bcp more powerful<end>
<start>what is all this about<end>
<start>for those who will all read<end>
<start>the divine attributes are too strong<end>
<start>gray<end>
<start>if just a classic oblivion he could have just talked to others about it but his existence is kind of blocking the power of the oblivion daemon that forces people to forget<end>
<start>his sense of shadow is so huge mtn<end>
<start>wait for shore forget it is volume no<end>
<start>you were or<end>
<start>even that is too ingenious<end>
<start>and nothing new until<end>
<start>you know rodr when a man and a woman love each other<end>
<start>good luck i already have a lead<end>
<start>i had a hard time interpreting the last sentence<end>
<start>it is always forbidden despite his age<end>
<start>it is said that it is a creature coming from the hollow mountains<end>
<start>like no shadow and it is ciao<end>
<start>at least i did not succeed<end>
<start>there is no connection to the forgotten demon<end>
<start>sovereign or maybe not we do not know but actually we would have said the domain of shadow at this moment dooonnc do we ever know<end>
<start>and then more at all open this living room almost to avoid spoil<end>
<start>ah he is making us live one of those things it is addictive<end>
<start>he could invoke his shadows only in his citadel<end>
<start>att bits the prince of nothing that does not die when one destroys his physical and spiritual bodies at the time of his introduction into the lower sky one had about ten chap with the word nothing to follow in their title<end>
<start>i understand you<end>
<start>yeah that is it<end>
<start>sah you are going to enjoy<end>
<start>because i do not know if it connects to the earth or it is a shadow circle<end>
<start>so he could not<end>
<start>good askip i do not have them anymore but yeah said just say his name he can know and that precisely his domain is not physical<end>
<start>but yes it is just theory<end>
<start>i am chap<end>
<start>an equivalent<end>
<start>yeah there are chances<end>
<start>i barely start webnovel<end>
<start>none that is finished<end>
<start>after holy sovereign it is vocabularies coming from the sortlege and since sunny is banished from the sortlege it is no longer exactly considered as holy or sovereign but between the two or finally for later what<end>
<start>pain<end>
<start>kind of my point of view c least important but c even when sunny's best friend<end>
<start>like the line she would share<end>
<start>actually after all it is necessary to quantify the importance of things stock coffee dead of the winter bete<end>
<start>or sunny can follow them to create her epee will probably end up at a time when they will meet i just hope that effie will be the<end>
<start>it is when even impressive our little sunny<end>
<start>all right i will go back<end>
<start>so probably there were extra stuff<end>
<start>in real sunny to fight it would be better to strengthen him by shadows each or he not strengthens<end>
<start>attention shocking image<end>
<start>it changes weeks waiting for manga<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewomb-pray-prayge-gif-<end>
<start>sah the only thing i am going to miss is neph in real life<end>
<start>i did not say he created the gods x if<end>
<start>for me cassie and effie will die kai no or at least not for now nephis probably not bitdret probably sunny no and jet laughs<end>
<start>cases will end up having the big head mdr<end>
<start>which would explain how he was able to recover the prophecy in the tower<end>
<start>i am up to date on your own<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwall-recorded-stick-fall-gif-<end>
<start>i really do not agree what did this just to make his choice to sunny bruh i am making arguments that i cannot give<end>
<start>that is what is happening to me right now mdr<end>
<start>we are probably not going to know the spectator and the fault for a long time<end>
<start>in any case i am having trouble seeing the larc end up in fashion all is well that ends well<end>
<start>i did not read noproblemcrying<end>
<start>they have just met they are not going to put us directly against a superior tyrant<end>
<start>personal it depends sometimes i tryhard when i get inside and sometimes it does not depend on my desire<end>
<start>or sunny<end>
<start>after i understand your pdv and it is all possible that he is waiting to be a sovereign<end>
<start>tyx gray<end>
<start>it is like you are showing a piece on a version or you are taking away all the horrors of the nd gm from someone who is got her as a soldier it is not like she is in the circle<end>
<start>something pretty chilly but that still impacts<end>
<start>in real sunny as a master could create shells of superior creatures as a saint it would make sense that he could create cursed rows of them knowing that he is literally able to clone himself for the moment but perhaps soon imagine bets cursed after it is true that it would not be enough against the bird but to remember he did not come into the pyramid alone but with neph so for me he has a chance even if it is more a fight of bossfin d'arc than a fight lambda<end>
<start>they must be below the kennel jpense<end>
<start>he will become the slave of the shadow<end>
<start>weaver did not create the rdr<end>
<start>while asterion already the fact that he is a dreamlike being is really strange<end>
<start>she is fucking the game a bit<end>
<start>well i need to know<end>
<start>when you think about it it is a little bit of a she will she is only supposed to help you for a while but if you stick to it too much she ends up slowing you down so if any day you will find someone who is out there he flew twice as much because he will have managed to get rid of him<end>
<start>what i would not give to forget and read again<end>
<start>you lose the core and the fragments accumulated<end>
<start>i am thinking of an exploiter to make industrial saints just need memories that can contain living beings of masters make them fit in then pass the third nightmares and boom a dozen saint<end>
<start>we are talking<end>
<start>because if he just breaks his bond with nephis it is enough for another person to say his real name at random bite and paf is again a slave<end>
<start>ptn jai succeeds in letting me return chap tt suddenly read his will do good<end>
<start>and seeing the mouth of the tomb dariel the citadel serves more than much since i think they do not want to go back from sitot<end>
<start>by destroying it<end>

<start>just one question if qqn knows<end>
<start>sunny fighting sunny of the future<end>
<start>in any case they will not have memory or anything since they are not bearers of the spell<end>
<start>if it is a snake<end>
<start>in real beast cursed it must be able to be tempted with just about the same conditions as daeron<end>
<start>he does what he wants<end>
<start>that song for song<end>
<start>and who knew more are divine aspect his line etc i imagine that nephis and sunny will have something really different from normal<end>
<start>in both directions of the term<end>
<start>thank you for the chaps the gray night<end>
<start>hold on tight buddy<end>
<start>in bed must be difficult too<end>

<start>jespere an official quality translation for orv one day but it will not be for long if it happens<end>
<start>like morgan valor blacksmiths etc<end>
<start>he was described as a great terror but may be that he has rank up jsp<end>
<start>ahhhh yes okkk<end>
<start>he is already seen without me<end>
<start>welp i am up to date<end>
<start>she is going to give it to her<end>
<start>and at the rank of sunny<end>
<start>it is all messed up<end>
<start>can be related to the notebook or even a pyramid memory<end>
<start>as long as it does not take too much space i think it is getting a little late<end>
<start>i am going to finish lotm before i think<end>
<start>he created the exit leg which is a kind of tuto to move faster<end>
<start>i have to find the chapter<end>
<start>nan in real life would mean that we were talking about a great clan in front of you and that thought so that in the end we could see nothing of them<end>
<start>yeah right<end>
<start>i was staying on the meeting in the cafe<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewout-disappear-bye-vanished-gif-<end>
<start>as first presentation<end>
<start>really it is powering his hyper-mysterious<end>
<start>i just realized that the moment i was thinking is already coming out shibalaugh i kind of confused the events mdr<end>
<start>in real life it will surprise me even if he makes a wish<end>
<start>end i confess<end>
<start>estuary is a variable that suppresses destiny so as such person can preview the entry of a being in<end>
<start>it is an interesting theory i find<end>
<start>the mother of ananke<end>
<start>strength and honour<end>
<start>bite if<end>
<start>and dcp a person tp by a saint will pass his nightmare as soon as he arrives<end>
<start>i am waiting for this<end>
<start>i had h of permanence<end>
<start>you understand why the cassie church was founded from the beprayangel coup<end>
<start>which are well above the lot<end>
<start>esperons<end>
<start>personal i like the concept ohv<end>
<start>to make plans to defeat the sovereign tkt shibalagh<end>
<start>in my head there were only kingdoms<end>
<start>some are already dead<end>
<start>it explains then x<end>
<start>besides you did not start the robbery<end>
<start>in fact by writing the message i understood since it is a loop<end>
<start>so mtn even asterion bows<end>
<start>that is what it says<end>
<start>you have arrived or in history<end>
<start>the performance is crazy<end>
<start>jai misses a ptdrrrrrr part<end>
<start>yes but there is no interest in them telling us now it is for his<end>
<start>and then we have to see what happened to morgan<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewlaugh-monk-he-point-gif-<end>
<start>keep reading<end>
<start>strongly possible<end>
<start>that is the thing i am most apprehensive about<end>
<start>in serious badass mode<end>
<start>but it will make so much evolue sunny too<end>
<start>bah in the end no<end>
<start>it is no use to the sunny different from his avatars he does not let them take care of super-creature<end>
<start>yeah but they are not parents<end>
<start>i do not think he could do it because of a breakie<end>
<start>dsl it is late<end>
<start>asterion makes me clearly think of adam de lotm with what bitert said i wonder what its aspect is<end>
<start>that is too bad<end>
<start>lack more than just and kai<end>
<start>they just had to mean that<end>
<start>it had been confirmed before or it is that now that the earth is the divine kingdom of war<end>
<start>what the creation responsible for the temple without name already<end>
<start>good kids no overflow please thank you<end>
<start>an unknown<end>
<start>you can explain<end>
<start>yes he is crazy and tetu shibalaugh and sunny future knows very well he probably warns her just by principle knowing that it served nothing that cassie did not do<end>
<start>or it is full of super-cheat memories but even when<end>
<start>or anvil jet<end>
<start>in any case the next promises to be masterclass<end>
<start>a week without a ss just after this crazy thing but let us keep her thank you for the milk gray<end>
<start>there is going to be a crazy thing<end>
<start>we will see if there is anything interesting about it<end>
<start>you find that the end is at the height of the volume<end>
<start>oh no no no no no<end>
<start>that is the number of weaving<end>
<start>so it is organic shadowing<end>
<start>like a sunny and a corrupt cassy who makes a nightmare<end>
<start>thanks for the chap bgtos<end>
<start>i think rather what is looking for a way to change the future that will happen to them nephis and she sees world in global but squarely not just for sunny<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>i asked if they were dead or not<end>
<start>like also there are creatures that are able to see when people look at them<end>
<start>and ba is a good bottle for lapero<end>
<start>it was worse before<end>
<start>no chap tonight<end>
<start>you think the rest of the cohort will pass supreme<end>
<start>weaver was not yet<end>
<start>and his stupid shadows<end>
<start>unrankable<end>
<start>there is a better chance that that is what the rest of it is<end>
<start>she said she just wanted to create a gun so she could beat the sunny destiny is that gun<end>
<start>not just nightmares<end>
<start>they do not have one<end>
<start>i have had so many amazing chills just<end>
<start>you doubted me but it is an epee<end>
<start>he is the best friend of sunny's he is too good a guy who does not deserve it would make him regret death<end>
<start>he said he knew it so he could be free<end>
<start>or maybe if but not shows<end>
<start>when sunny passes titan then snake can transfo into winter bet<end>
<start>but level information she will be able to have from sunny if he makes her a bracelet that gives her information like the sortlege and so that her concrete is there is cassia who can always know the power she has and transmit them to sunny as soon as she awakens her appearance<end>
<start>no i do not think so<end>
<start>not long research literally first chapter<end>
<start>oe but you are saying things just because you saw that he was causing conflict or was determined<end>
<start>that is a little the point<end>
<start>nan vrmt since ro it comes out to us that masterclasses it is amazing how she is super well-written developed and how she evolves outside of sunny i think it is really she who had the biggest evolution of the work<end>
<start>of memory it seems to me that no<end>
<start>but so the crazy prince is sunny of the future<end>
<start>cassie church on this server was based after these events jsp if you knew mdrrrr<end>
<start>it is really fun to see effie try to limit his vocabulary lately<end>
<start>plus it has a double sense and tt<end>
<start>mdrr you are going to put all his church on your back<end>
<start>i forgot<end>
<start>spoil you are going to start reading again by the end of the work<end>
<start>i have been imagining so much higher-in-row whoo-eater<end>
<start>two months probably<end>
<start>it was shocking<end>
<start>ah dacc bah i will watch on webnovel it may be more on when even<end>
<start>it is a possibility not to separate<end>
<start>that is it for the master part you have to have an aspect and a defect to be able to pass master naturally but for the supremacy not to remember the necessity of a real name<end>
<start>his physical what<end>
<start>but i am surprised<end>
<start>since we know that ananke could have climbed transcendent without nightmares<end>
<start>all together form a collective failure<end>
<start>they are mostly grooved<end>
<start>during this time-cassia had to hit her best series<end>
<start>but as he showed her post ellipse memories she does not forget<end>
<start>i hate to see the beginning of the war<end>
<start>for your people<end>
<start>it does not look like a worm<end>
<start>i confess ya resemblance fan of the goat too<end>
<start>it is my anime deesse<end>
<start>but after i see not pq you hope to have it there are much better ways to make evolute people<end>
<start>a bastard dog<end>
<start>there is something that i am getting away from right now why hop said the daemons were the faults of the gods<end>
<start>he does not need to follow nephis to forge lepee it is true that everything is more funny with effie shibalaugh<end>
<start>oe c for her jai a little hard to believe in cassy help<end>
<start>tossed out of laughter<end>
<start>well he can weave on something other than memory<end>
<start>there is no reason for him to meet<end>
<start>it will be too late for a lot of people<end>
<start>you are or<end>
<start>why not share the power boost of the domain<end>
<start>after without sovereign they can do nothing<end>
<start>jsp if we send her already since it is been a long time not opening the channel<end>
<start>i will be surprised that the bird is still in the tomb if it is where it came back<end>
<start>the real problem is not so much defeating the bird i think but rather catching it<end>
<start>i do not even have the words<end>
<start>i needed a chap like this after lantarctic and the darial tomb<end>
<start>nan he woke up on it<end>
<start>nn nephis and sunny<end>
<start>not wrong but i appreciate my reading for now<end>
<start>he is proud to do this anyway<end>
<start>we are not going to mix with the michels<end>
<start>httpsvmtiktokcomzgexjabv loneliness sin<end>
<start>has no relation to the shadows<end>
<start>on that good night<end>
<start>but he is spoiled<end>
<start>after lord of shadows you think it will be what the next title<end>
<start>reflecting<end>
<start>i am going to try to stop<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrr one can always find good finally<end>
<start>i am sorry<end>
<start>finally for a hint what<end>
<start>so as you feel it but it is still transition for now<end>
<start>in any case to freeze this chapter<end>
<start>pepesadhug<end>
<start>we are going to laugh<end>
<start>they are very intimately bound<end>
<start>he will be like a saint<end>
<start>yes i am still on how i am going to do it ahah read every day or wait for the end of a volume<end>
<start>at least he will not wait to be divine to go<end>
<start>and seeing that holy is his first shadow<end>
<start>mdr running gag effie<end>
<start>it is just the wish of sunny was realized in the estuary<end>
<start>ah man ajd no one will move me from my bed<end>
<start>moreover the pretres of the exitlege there was one that entered the pyramid not<end>
<start>interesting ahah<end>
<start>because it looks like they are going to wait for nephis and sunny to conquer the world to go through the nightmare<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewasterix-pas-content-protest-chanting-not-happy-gif-<end>
<start>hahaha we are together man<end>
<start>it is not stupid in real life but it is a little hair-pushed<end>
<start>the sortlege probably has a limit<end>
<start>but sunny he lost the shadow fragment no<end>
<start>okay it seemed good to me<end>
<start>yes clearly it adds the enchantment of the moon to invoke instant<end>
<start>he is got quartz in his farm<end>
<start>yep exactly nothing worse just a reset<end>
<start>in real level happiness yes<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewjoseph-joestar-nice-good-job-gif-<end>
<start>yeah it is the right side of being a day i agree<end>
<start>it will not move goat one day always goat<end>
<start>he created a technique to beat the mirror maze and for nephis he must never really have reflected on how to kill her even if he will be able to do so if he wanted to create a memory or murder<end>
<start>we saw them die against the immortal butcher<end>
<start>yes that is possible<end>
<start>he had no divine aspect at the time he had the slave sleeping aspect of the temple and was marked by the symbol of the shadow<end>
<start>and snake can cut off these snake wills would have something to do with the neant of the blow<end>
<start>maybe he just wanted troll knowing what was going to happen or maybe he would regret it while he knew that but it would not have been better if he did not<end>
<start>it is going to taste a yen that is going to come out<end>
<start>eft i tell you why i ask her<end>
<start>i swear he got marbled<end>
<start>okay okay thank you but so with gray's announcement it means the next chapters are going to come out on<end>
<start>because with sunny<end>
<start>nan but i got confused<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>i already tried<end>
<start>like he cz goes what for him<end>
<start>oe but sunny lost the line<end>
<start>and at the worst sunny steals the thief we often forget that his appearance and half offensive the other half is authoritarian<end>
<start>wait for the ellipse is years by counting year in bastion<end>
<start>but he had more of his shadows jcrois<end>
<start>singing or not making a difference<end>
<start>i did not like it<end>
<start>ha i understand your messages better<end>
<start>but the nightmare's exit may still interargine with sunny even if he has lost his destiny<end>
<start>farewell dear people<end>
<start>if i cannot let anyone laura<end>
<start>the appearance of the winter beast<end>
<start>wait i will make it better x<end>
<start>ah in fashion every divine aspect would be the sight of a god<end>
<start>even those of valor etc<end>
<start>but normally it is not supposed to be able to make the connection between the unknown person of memories and the sons of the shadow<end>
<start>nan in real life i abuse rather the same level as the eating cloud<end>
<start>but by the way i just thought about it the way do not sunny survives in the hollow mountains it affirms its will on the world in the way of condemnation nan<end>
<start>if that is what ananke told us<end>
<start>darial tomb<end>
<start>holy who is being exploited shibalaugh<end>
<start>the skull with the eyes<end>
<start>it seems strange to me to hide from the reader an encounter with a person as important as asterion<end>
<start>you think it will be what the supremacy of mortret<end>
<start>even worse<end>
<start>by the way gray i would be interested to know your opinion on this nightmare ending<end>
<start>at the same time the author of crest of soul does not charge the chaps so it is not very difficult to be trql<end>
<start>it is just sanctions when you violate copyright<end>
<start>i think because when you compare what he did for himself it is not so much<end>
<start>mmh in fact ueep but the scene is too short not quite impacting i find<end>
<start>in real life we are laughing but<end>
<start>psq her in limmediat he has direct enemies<end>
<start>what is going on<end>
<start>i think i will read the last volume when it is finished<end>
<start>c not the same lvl we will say<end>
<start>but i really feel like that<end>
<start>especially that the sovereigns are almost invincible in their domain and they are not so stupid as to come out voluntarily to fight for them so they have nothing to fear from a saint as powerful as nephis<end>
<start>doping free<end>
<start>you like what you saw huh<end>
<start>yeah i can see vaguely<end>
<start>we know that in the universe of ss everything is about circumstances<end>
<start>which chapter<end>
<start>what crazy development for sunny<end>
<start>levger problem is coming back in not long<end>
<start>i did not even know her blaz to tell you<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewrage-red-stocks-crash-stocks-crashing-downwards-gif-<end>
<start>ptdrrrr but naan<end>
<start>but if the mad prince is born more shadow he can more transfo because as sunny says when he activated his transfo his shadows have disappeared<end>
<start>privilege experience in theory<end>
<start>like just tattoo gives boosts and protects his soul<end>
<start>but already minimum<end>
<start>and saying that she is married and has a kid when even shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>but there is no version fr for orv this is a shame<end>
<start>c good<end>
<start>i do not think the seeds of the nightmare are really at the origin of the integration of the other kingdoms for me it would be more like a consequence to see something that has nothing to see<end>
<start>but you have to let me know when there is stuff like that i thought it was you who had the rights<end>
<start>praise the holy high by the wolves athena<end>
<start>real it is possible that they have to step in to protect groove at some point if she really participates in the war<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmichael-jackson-enjoying-lol-michael-jackson-gif-<end>
<start>i was thinking about it but i did not have that much development but i like it<end>
<start>wiki helped me find<end>
<start>the one where he makes his entire journey to the black skull is very interesting he gives a lot of clue on his default<end>
<start>he had already weaving bones his teeth were going to hold on<end>
<start>attention pain in approach and possibility of mental suicide<end>
<start>wow the ch<end>
<start>in v it is weak<end>
<start>mdrr ah yeah detere<end>
<start>one day you will read i know that is all that matters in the end<end>
<start>he is been there hundreds of times without cassia being at the origin<end>
<start>ah though the second was for the shadow god not<end>
<start>oe<end>
<start>he goes to the entrance into the city<end>
<start>and when he gets back into the seed he will make his second nightmare<end>
<start>the first one who will fight against him he will end up like jiraya for bread<end>
<start>it is just that even in this cassie carrier flight a little bit<end>
<start>i always get a machiavelic genius from the bars<end>
<start>goes lost light<end>
<start>laughs<end>
<start>especially as their relationship was seriously developed during the same<end>
<start>i take over ss and i attack the volume<end>
<start>yeah it is a sybil<end>
<start>acupuncture<end>
<start>real<end>
<start>romance when even between nephis and sunny in the volume<end>
<start>what do you want<end>
<start>he will not believe me<end>
<start>no you did not misunderstand the chapter sunny obliterated the winter beast<end>
<start>but otherwise<end>
<start>not wrong but it is happening<end>
<start>i find that his wife fits perfectly<end>
<start>the same way for a different goal jfound it would not be so confusing i am going to<end>
<start>it is not confirmed but it fits her well<end>
<start>unless you start from the principle what lies<end>
<start>and so<end>
<start>which<end>
<start>i read wrong<end>
<start>what is the difference between the fact that sunny wants her freedom and her fate<end>
<start>for now we do not know what cassie saw as a finalite because she said in an old chapter that she knew her fate her death and i imagine that of the cohort and to prevent her from creating a variable but we do not know that finalite she wanted to prevent and which is probably the same as when sunny does not intervene<end>
<start>wholesale<end>
<start>even the bond of the shadow is what allowed sunny to surpass herself to catch up when they were separated<end>
<start>so sunny removed the fallen creations that were spawling logic<end>
<start>that is why being up to date hurts<end>
<start>jsp it was never precise<end>
<start>sunny does not want to get too involved in the war as a sunless master i cannot see him following nephis during the war<end>
<start>we agree sunny cannot lie by message<end>
<start>ah you are talking about asterion<end>
<start>g will not change pov at a time when nothing happens<end>
<start>even so they are not going to be in the war<end>
<start>she did not flame the souls until she had her appearance<end>
<start>just psq there is a kiss ptdrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>i think the same<end>
<start>after seeing<end>
<start>it is true that we are half the work<end>
<start>how<end>
<start>saint different<end>
<start>yup it is true that a few days for a daily publication it leaves a small void between two but it is not serious qlq days it is nothing and yes but for that you irritated so trql x after that everyone has to learn to play the game instead except the humorous side of my sentence turn as much to make a general reminder you trad on your free time to allow the france and the french to read slavic shadow for free and with a fr version of quality there are imperatives to avoid the problems you bend yourself there and it is logical you are not going to risk taking legal sanctions for that so now it is to the others to play the game they are up to date on the release is so much better but they do not come to disturb those who stay on your trad the work has chapters of delay and that is how they will learn patience or lose access to the channel so thanks to the readers who respect camilicoeur<end>
<start>he just opened a possibility of almost total action for the sequel so jsuis hype died<end>
<start>really sure he is going solo<end>
<start>that we all did<end>
<start>i told gray it was in the name of wn shibalaugh<end>
<start>i think i am going to put some piece in webnovel<end>
<start>say his a sunny<end>
<start>just sunny and nephis are anomalies<end>
<start>it is not because they are brothers that anvil could not pass it on to him<end>
<start>everything actually makes sense except why they went down there i do not understand<end>
<start>where he goes spawn in the nightmare<end>
<start>and why not<end>
<start>you will have to reform it completely<end>
<start>he lost it<end>
<start>seeing the mastermind that cassie is i think she had planned<end>
<start>this will probably suppose it is true after is what sunny would not give a fake<end>
<start>no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no<end>
<start>advance<end>
<start>for example during the campaign when he uses the lantern to hide and that sunny vs hundreds of creations of the nightmare<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewpuppy-tiered-tired-puppy-doggo-cute-puppy-gif-<end>
<start>i do not see him ending up bad at the pts in a serious style scene in fashion you<end>
<start>he could be an asterion bastard with his aspect tied to the soul<end>
<start>so<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewartoholickarans-gif-<end>
<start>it is crazy how g happens to make us understand directly it is what pov has all or almost the pov nephis he places lord of the shadow in the er paragraph<end>
<start>i am reading the x<end>
<start>remember dusk<end>
<start>you read the chapter<end>
<start>bah level in equivalent memory<end>
<start>ahhhh the famous antarctica<end>
<start>yeah but i think it will be for something not yet out<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewgif-gif-<end>
<start>he struggled to beat a corrupt titan<end>
<start>and the real name must be linked to the sortlege<end>
<start>that is what she thought she saw<end>
<start>so that is probably it<end>
<start>to continue the propaganda pepeevil<end>
<start>ever more complicated let us go<end>
<start>but i think about it<end>
<start>mmh yes is true but good<end>
<start>the bird the odds everyone forgets it it comes back week after only valor a ferry so there is no real losses of this rating i know not there is something missing to impact ro y had this score sunny lost its biggest asset you know it for me he did not lose everything he has to win<end>
<start>because he did not get it<end>
<start>i understand i love everything but some have made me vibrates that others<end>
<start>damage it does not work shibalaugh<end>
<start>on the other hand you made me think he could have been friends again with the cohort he says everything that happened in front of kai and it probably goes a little too simple and not interesting according to g to regulate it like that<end>
<start>we talked about it not long ago<end>
<start>therefore the rule is still present<end>
<start>we must have the ability to link<end>
<start>how his book really shadow slave on amazon '-'<end>
<start>like a memory that can serve as armor for a saint who adapts to his post transfo morphology<end>
<start>she did not kill him<end>
<start>you are not going to read every day<end>
<start>the result of the poll of popularite a gives what besides on the serv of g<end>
<start>good night bebou gray<end>
<start>thank you for the chap gray<end>
<start>ba is a corrupt terror snake the<end>
<start>i say the same before<end>
<start>she is sublime though<end>
<start>chaptersday at times he posts chapter one day and the next he posts<end>
<start>but it confirms to me that theft is my favorite<end>
<start>i understand that does not worry you for so little<end>
<start>there you go<end>
<start>his nothing waits for you to see more tonight pepeevil<end>
<start>it is a crazy thing how people think that sunny beats nephis without any difficulty when he can literally not kill her the same thing for biting<end>
<start>that is what chapter<end>
<start>yeah a lepoque where this giga chad knew alone on the chained islands<end>
<start>in a few days<end>
<start>the simple gap of terror has titan fill not<end>
<start>yeah okay i see because i was starting from the principle that since he is a mongrel with or without destiny he can say he is because it is a verite in itself and he can say it by wearing the mask because since mongrel is sunny and sunny has disappeared with his destiny from the collective memory he could say he is because it is a lie since he does not exist<end>
<start>yes but we now have them different weaving that remains to be discovered and my little finger tells me that he will be able without bad to recreate the exitlege for him<end>
<start>not a unique field of fire and shadow<end>
<start>perso jai tjr not read since the break i stack at least until tonight to have a lot to read at once<end>
<start>nan the difference between the levels its exponential probably sunny will suffice to hold a little and again<end>
<start>for that i ask ptdrrrrrr<end>
<start>i feel so much that at some point sunny is going to go out in a groove i have an appointment with a star<end>
<start>there is not one thing the old awakens did not direct an aspect<end>
<start>he would not steal powers from the demon of oblivion<end>
<start>i had already assimilated the two grave to a theory in relation to the first nep and sunny cockamard<end>
<start>yeah actually the infects of the sortlege can do it from the sleeping stadium as much for me ehe<end>
<start>i also think he is trying to create something but i do not know if it is going to make sense of what sunny wants<end>
<start>and prince of nothing psq he will destroy valor and he will be prince of nothing at that time<end>
<start>but where are the others<end>
<start>sunny's not so stupid as to fight him even shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>but then you do not really lose the core<end>
<start>you got something against pipo impchan<end>
<start>then if you succeed in finding a seed of the level nightmare you can trust it and become a master<end>
<start>i cannot imagine efficacious titan colossal<end>
<start>not yet<end>
<start>the little ones could have expanded<end>
<start>but even by the bird thief like no depressing by getting his sons ripped off even if he says he could have died if it was not over in time the nightmare it feels funny about all this quite on the contrary choice of the author i think but i am not a personal fan<end>
<start>it does not tell you as much as some people have here<end>
<start>but i am here now<end>
<start>i think it is a swarm of my superior<end>
<start>sunny dark city said something<end>
<start>yeah okay<end>
<start>potential weaving of destiny or mind weaving<end>
<start>mdrrrrr<end>
<start>lo is good but there is too 'banal' bcp fighting like this<end>
<start>anyhow having nephis basic in his team is a cheese code to win a war<end>
<start>you make me doubt<end>
<start>the combat intelligence of a chihuahua<end>
<start>they have to hear them<end>
<start>how to find sleep when in some chapters we get our first sunless saint<end>
<start>but my god<end>
<start>yes destiny helped him find them but in chaps i would not call it not to stop finding shibalaugh<end>
<start>or else it is enough that it gives on space i think at some point it explained that most of the doors were in space and in the sea<end>
<start>hutaoblank<end>
<start>i do not really believe<end>
<start>good and well part two of the ending nightmare for me<end>
<start>so we do or it does not change anything in the end<end>
<start>he is probably a little mdr<end>
<start>maybe he was wearing the mask<end>
<start>i pray that my theory will be true sunny and bite together against the world nephis ps it dates from the volume prince of nothing that i have done this to my head and hope it is strong x<end>
<start>normal when you love it you love it at the bottom of every volume<end>
<start>i am thinking of waking up in the next chapter<end>
<start>more than chap nephis<end>
<start>farodrisitasetonne<end>
<start>yeah i think so too<end>
<start>because time does not exist in the estuary<end>
<start>but then she is a little weird like if we cut her head off she dies<end>
<start>if weaver is the name of my ak- then yes<end>
<start>by counting the gods and the people we know<end>
<start>jet peak<end>
<start>he will take over all the buzz he is ever had<end>
<start>i have a question now that the sunny before no longer exists is what it can say that it is mongrel without and with the mask of weaver<end>
<start>no the volume ends very soon<end>
<start>i think vrm is not because she is beaten in antarctica<end>
<start>we do not know what is a transfo sainte can be that it is a thing previewed from the beginning in this case yes she is not going to change or maybe it is from what we lived and in this case she can change<end>
<start>on the other hand the chapters that come out a h and more and more later<end>
<start>we exodia the cursed in ss and nobody talks about it<end>
<start>maybe they like their favorite hote sunless<end>
<start>same<end>
<start>see what is going to happen to sunny<end>
<start>really good luck<end>
<start>sirene<end>
<start>nan but that is not what you think nep i did this to help you in no way for my personal desire<end>
<start>hide you kids gray is back shockk<end>
<start>ah but very clearly i felt that he was going to be alone in this decision<end>
<start>without epee she gets started<end>
<start>irritated by watching just shibalaugh<end>
<start>the holy mtn are better than they before<end>
<start>the vocabulary is so complicated that it in the writing of g<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewzemmour-oh-bah-so-like-cest-bizarre-gif-<end>
<start>okay i found thanks for the trick<end>
<start>but nan reading the chapters when they come out it allows to discuss it here to make theories etc<end>
<start>i too but frankly the only fights that gave me so much thrill reading it is sunnynephis at the top of the tower at the shore forgets and the winter beast of falcon scott<end>
<start>i hope he will still have the right to his hours of glory further<end>
<start>that is stupid<end>
<start>you think cassie has been spying on all their interactions after actually seeing maybe cassie will be hiding information<end>
<start>thank you my sovereign emiliahappy<end>
<start>banger mrc gray chaps<end>
<start>if he talks with sunny under mask he detects what kai<end>
<start>technically he already has a beta laugh<end>
<start>thespect temporal paradox etc is so well managed in larc in addition<end>
<start>but i thought later in fashion when it would be of supreme rank or sacre<end>
<start>he creates epees in a loop to have the enchantment he needs to kill that song or asterion<end>
<start>nephis i do not know if she is expres but she has a gift to get younger<end>
<start>he is got too much stuff<end>
<start>but what the asterion powers mm we know nothing about him nn<end>
<start>sunny breaks her destiny<end>
<start>but not yet<end>
<start>at your risk and pearls<end>
<start>not necessarily but yes it is transmitted in a hereditary way except in certain cases without knowing really why by reflecting it it may be possible to transmit it by blood but literally shibalaugh as what might be done that song with his adopted daughters they speak of a ritual with blood of remembrance<end>
<start>yes crazy and their mentality<end>
<start>especially me<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>but she is going to have to explain and he cannot even lie in his explanation he is screwed<end>
<start>still banker<end>
<start>good tyrant cursed either sunny escapes alone or he has enough gas to get off with nephis<end>
<start>he does not make the best choices to him<end>
<start>for me weaver is right above<end>
<start>so kai's powers should work and we come back to yesterday's discussion<end>
<start>anyway it is really cool right now<end>
<start>but we cannot know<end>
<start>personal i think of the death of effie<end>
<start>personal i would say no<end>
<start>miraculous rescue<end>
<start>but he knows that he never let us a saint as powerful not be watched<end>
<start>so he is got to be that douchebag<end>
<start>that nephis is not a couple<end>
<start>there is a world or the well of wishes has not this ability to pass through the exit leg and that it is not able to make disappear the bond of shadow without killing nephis<end>
<start>groove<end>
<start>i do not doubt it<end>
<start>like he could not turn into a snake with the clones at the same time<end>
<start>there has not been one lately<end>
<start>seeing that sunny is a mystery and he knows them well<end>
<start>my memory works ohhv<end>
<start>nan vrm on the other hand i believe that if it is ever adapted in webtoon or anime the scene it would be ptn of epic<end>
<start>if that is what i do not see how to move forward in work later kind of by logic it is a man without destiny who has to break it so if he does not manage to free himself from the chains of the bahhhh destiny i do not see what could help sunny fight against the events<end>
<start>guys just real sunny he made an erwin no<end>
<start>not necessarily just to stop him from killing nephis<end>
<start>but if a work i would find that is at the same level that ss will make chapweek i could never hold<end>
<start>it is two pdvs who defend themselves in real life<end>
<start>yeah but sunny has influenced us all with her endless curiositis<end>
<start>the goat is back<end>
<start>i am not going to explain life to you<end>
<start>it was not just because the thief pif took his destiny<end>
<start>but who says it does not limit to the end<end>
<start>look with the king of dread at dusk who asked for sunny and kai to kneel i think it is something like<end>
<start>it is going to boost all his shadows to him like making them harder to destroy or something<end>
<start>eat your spoil at home mtn<end>
<start>i think it is a lot more<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewseb-i-know-not-can-not-can-no-idcae-gif-<end>
<start>it will not surprise me that asterion that looks discreet in nature does not show up in the big day be related to shadows too<end>
<start>that i find it just classic a little i do not know how to explain in brief<end>
<start>fallen<end>
<start>they did not see each other so much<end>
<start>you will get over it<end>
<start>the gatekeeper level made me think too much about this scene<end>
<start>but he does not have the shadows<end>
<start>totally expres and i am even under an obligation to do like this<end>
<start>well seen<end>
<start>no need to rip it all off if just pull it off does the same effect<end>
<start>the elders know the fall of falcon scott<end>
<start>not in my memory but she knows kai<end>
<start>yeah for me it is on the road<end>
<start>and mtn you want to know the next one in it you have got to what<end>
<start>i wonder if it is at the same time<end>
<start>i am chap la<end>
<start>in view player mode<end>
<start>c that i said is true too<end>
<start>yeah okay that is right<end>
<start>that sounds familiar but i do not know when<end>
<start>gg<end>
<start>and between intelligent people fighting and an idiot and the other intelligent there is a difference<end>
<start>it is not the lantern<end>
<start>he said he recovered the bed from the priest in the cathedral<end>
<start>cassy in mode<end>
<start>like king of shadows emperor or just ruler of shadows<end>
<start>it would hurt me<end>
<start>vaso simmer guys<end>
<start>thank you for the gray chaps<end>
<start>oh it is nothing sunny the tyrants wake up they killed them without even putting a pee before his habalaaugh<end>
<start>the mask has an enchantment that makes the divinations invisible<end>
<start>imagine the people who will end up in a few years and there will be no chapter after<end>
<start>the real name used to guide it with the baton<end>
<start>i am not asking to be spoiled but i just wanted to know if yes<end>
<start>and fortunately pcq i would have taken so expensive the good rating of things is that now i stock the chapters and wait to post them<end>
<start>after that is true we have never seen this kind of door before<end>
<start>jsp how he is done for stack so much chap mddr me jsis too press<end>
<start>see the main character suffer is a primary need for a slavic shadow player<end>
<start>i just hope that sunny gives him the bracelet that mimics the exitlege<end>
<start>except the one i do not get or maybe the question is oriented itself even if i do not see why<end>
<start>probably it can always progress but it can no longer ask for the rewards<end>
<start>after i think he is also a little crazy basic<end>
<start>i think it is going to be the first<end>
<start>in a nightmare you are quickly in danger beluga<end>
<start>he will be back soon<end>
<start>sscassy<end>
<start>i realized moment was shocking<end>
<start>i forgot about the mystery with the moon<end>
<start>and so i think these visions can change knowing that this sunny moment was part of destiny<end>
<start>she has no heritage<end>
<start>yes but you only have to come in there is still the dish and the dessert shimaaugh<end>
<start>see if sunny can still go to her sea of the soul<end>
<start>oh pitie<end>
<start>yes i think valor will strengthen himself to death for fear of a holy mortet<end>
<start>my brain's burning up<end>
<start>the chaps are super cool i like it<end>
<start>the results of the popularite poll of shadow slave have arrived httpsforgotten-shorenotionsiteshadow-slave-efacebcccbdcda<end>
<start>a little bad formula but you got the idea<end>
<start>i would be smitten by her divine line she never disappeared like that<end>
<start>thank you<end>
<start>ptdrrrrrr we know her laughing<end>
<start>pwah i quickly read i did not understand i think that is the sign for me to resume reading<end>
<start>how do you get that kind of display<end>
<start>ez<end>
<start>one day i was in his place and it is mostly my health that i have gun<end>
<start>end of volume<end>
<start>but how holy it is worth it is strange when even<end>
<start>on the other hand i have a question there is no connection with the bird thief and the well<end>
<start>find in the chap when it shows that all the creatures turn north<end>
<start>and as mtn ya a site you cannot just banish the guy from discord<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewkurapika-heart-chain-hunter-x-hunter-hxh-gif-<end>
<start>and give up<end>
<start>there is always morgan available otherwise<end>
<start>tener little fanart of morgan<end>
<start>and there was only one or its shadow<end>
<start>a very nice breakfast<end>
<start>it is complicated to imagine the domain since i am almost sure it will not have a simple domain like that danvil<end>
<start>either he can try to imitate him<end>
<start>but a priori he needs the mirror to own someone he must first infiltrate with the help of a mirror or another person possesses<end>
<start>sunny is like the strongest saint in history i think especially<end>
<start>it stays there<end>
<start>it is your screen i will let you ping do not do that i laugh you will get justiced mdr<end>
<start>sunny must not be quoted<end>
<start>and half of the population is extinct<end>
<start>ts is so useful<end>
<start>bah precisely there is a report<end>
<start>-<end>
<start>on a chair of shadow of course<end>
<start>i change snake with fielon i am going to<end>
<start>at his age sunny killed fallen tyrants<end>
<start>why<end>
<start>by the<end>
<start>exactly we saw him with the nightmare chain<end>
<start>it took a month of setup<end>
<start>after a long night of sleep i think only of the sovereigns and has the huge volume that will be tasted<end>
<start>or you spoil me<end>
<start>kiss my irritated ptit<end>
<start>but if she tells him you know him<end>
<start>nan but really all the reflections she makes she has the humor of my friend<end>
<start>i confess when you said shadow at the beginning i was thinking the shadow of sunny kind happy and other my bad<end>
<start>apethinking<end>
<start>that<end>
<start>neph<end>
<start>his first kill<end>
<start>imagine getting out of his room shibalaugh<end>
<start>i say shit<end>
<start>in this volume we have bcq of evil to visualize the limits of this new sunny<end>
<start>i am looking for the extract and i am telling you again<end>
<start>but so he must have a problem somewhere<end>
<start>then i do not think he is going to<end>
<start>but yes a divine who pops in them is possible<end>
<start>over the years<end>
<start>so he is just washing since it is still an exceptional saint and the day she rebelliouss he shoots nephis and here is the rule<end>
<start>all sucks the guy's gone immortal especially there like this<end>
<start>i was talking about you laughing<end>
<start>it is just going to end on the start of the war<end>
<start>yes anyway it remains the goal of a break even if it is manipulated<end>
<start>hm<end>
<start>a every time<end>
<start>but sunny's got us crazy stuff how his citadel mdr the guy has the power of a supreme<end>
<start>after the lines may go up well before the exit<end>
<start>we believe you mtn tkt just had a little bit of pain<end>
<start>fucking crazy<end>
<start>but it does not change the fact that he is immortal<end>
<start>i love the pov i groove<end>
<start>for me the death of effie i specify when even i love the person because one can think that no can bring a real more in the hisory<end>
<start>what an idea to talk to people<end>
<start>att i will copy the question<end>
<start>but i guess the gods did not die alone<end>
<start>nah you are banished from our church you<end>
<start>for people who know his cohort identity and morgan ok but otherwise he still has to exist<end>
<start>the true queen takes the place<end>
<start>the little drawing explodes<end>
<start>nan on the other hand must talk about it<end>
<start>i really do not feel it<end>
<start>but if the law of the world is sacred it is his thing<end>
<start>that is because he was destined before he got laid<end>
<start>actually the mastermind of the work<end>
<start>it was just about a confrontation it seems to me<end>
<start>i want to see noctis again<end>
<start>it is really the advantage of reading every day you can discuss what is going on with everyone<end>
<start>it is that sunny i think<end>
<start>reading in english is not the problem but if you have to question each chapter on a bit of a complicated word it gets you out of the story<end>
<start>yes<end>
<start>he takes that day off that guy is punched with the skull<end>
<start>we cannot have everything at once too<end>
<start>mhhhh i confess<end>
<start>what<end>
<start>that is really it<end>
<start>so it does not necessarily mean nothing like you use it in everyday life<end>
<start>and you have to keep a coherent story<end>
<start>the old nether armor<end>
<start>i am sure you said later<end>
<start>uh because he did not have more push time than that<end>
<start>but i do not think so<end>
<start>i remember a moment or bitert said not directly that his aspect is connected to the reflection he just says in a few kinds<end>
<start>we do not know the evolution of their aspects<end>
<start>and interchangeable but i think the same if not<end>
<start>heritage excuse me<end>
<start>i do not know if he wants to free the god forget or let him lock up<end>
<start>of course they quickly made themselves calm but the modos there banned the ships with groove<end>
<start>lacquer<end>
<start>for<end>
<start>jpp of his horrible characters who respect nothing<end>
<start>some guys who were defiled by the first researcher's truth<end>
<start>ohhh amazing brooo you have succeeded ohhv<end>
<start>after by message i think it is ok otherwise if he writes and sends the message in theory he should have the migraine infinity and in the chap it is only out loud<end>
<start>well that means the line comes before the exit leg<end>
<start>yeah but i confess i loved them all<end>
<start>yes tkt<end>
<start>i do not think it is a specificity of the nuclei of the soul and their rank<end>
<start>tkt i understood<end>
<start>i just say you put him in a fight he loses against whom<end>
<start>and again it is blurred because ananke was just transcendent<end>
<start>but really<end>
<start>arthurno<end>
<start>i think it was a memory<end>
<start>in any case if you are nice you count months on average per revolution<end>
<start>yen has words<end>
<start>she could kill her by inattention or by a crazy laugh<end>
<start>weaver sure<end>
<start>yup each his rhythm is better<end>
<start>what i wanted to say is that he can afford not to use his ability to melt using only one sunny<end>
<start>because otherwise they could probably have found better than a piece of propaganda on the lantarctic campaign what<end>
<start>but leave him<end>
<start>in chapter he mentioned that he did not ring his flaw with his inside the third nightmare everything i find on the wiki<end>
<start>i confess i was shocked that fielon was passing superior<end>
<start>not on<end>
<start>coincidence hmm<end>
<start>the shitty piaf there<end>
<start>he says he is a winner<end>
<start>aster would have been enough<end>
<start>imp<end>
<start>yeah i do not know<end>
<start>- yeah<end>
<start>bah the shore precisely<end>
<start>he is a nightmare<end>
<start>bah perso i am decu<end>
<start>i am messing up<end>
<start>yeah but i guess we do not know who knows if<end>
<start>ah but yes i forgot<end>
<start>this chapter takes you tripe it was amazing<end>
<start>sunny can stick it back<end>
<start>as long as you like it is cool<end>
<start>but yes weaver had to know the next few days<end>
<start>askillgib<end>
<start>but seeing what has already almost lost as a master against a mordet decreases<end>
<start>i think if she had visions after the sunny nightmare can change them as he is liberating from destiny because fate had probably not taken into account the fact that someone escapes her<end>
<start>so existences with strong will can survive the neant<end>
<start>he ripped out countless wires<end>
<start>soon<end>
<start>so sunny was a teacher to work for the weapon is an explorer writes books a saint a restaurant merchant sorcerer slave a child of the mongrel street and devil detrived fate and soon knight how you want that cassie so not to find and wonder that she became a little crazy<end>
<start>what<end>
<start>he is the most powerful man in the world<end>
<start>i arrived at the antarctic arch<end>
<start>must be awake nan<end>
<start>finally to day mamaaaa this long<end>
<start>a spoil is a spoil<end>
<start>speaking<end>
<start>one of the greatest mystery ss<end>
<start>he sang a little rhyme<end>
<start>oh okay mdr i did not read her<end>
<start>alder<end>
<start>they are the best<end>
<start>it is really terrible what happened to sunny after<end>
<start>if in fact<end>
<start>and you have to go from sleeper to wake up too<end>
<start>actually no i said i am the one who cannot read<end>
<start>she is going to want her personal cook<end>
<start>and i am pretty sure i am next to the plate<end>
<start>please respect the tristan they do not ask for any generalites<end>
<start>it is so real<end>
<start>it looks like it is the end for a little while<end>
<start>besides we have how many powers the snake has discovered it has developed since<end>
<start>in addition to what i understood naeve is not the son of the noctambula i think it is something like his nephew<end>
<start>ah nan jsuis con i just misread<end>
<start>at the estuary<end>
<start>like you find no mention of him in the sortlege sunny understood because he is able to translate the forbidden ruins<end>
<start>if we talk about pure power not on that bite is top<end>
<start>well man we did not read the mm open part he said that basically the sunny of the future that says to be just a simple saint answered the question after a certain delay as if he had invoked a memory so basically he probably invoked weaver mask to lie<end>
<start>it comes mainly into the rules of the server<end>
<start>just make him find the piaf<end>
<start>sadly<end>
<start>but we do not know if it is nothing or nothing<end>
<start>just before the nightmare<end>
<start>to respect tradition<end>
<start>i missed situations like this<end>
<start>and ivory lily that can invoke crumbling like this is super powerful<end>
<start>the beautiful epoch<end>
<start>yeah it is true that memories count<end>
<start>one day they will all remember the name of the god forget<end>
<start>you are on how much<end>
<start>thank you<end>
<start>i think it will just be a nicer dragon mdrrr<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewssailor-moon-transformation-gif-<end>
<start>in real life this is the perfect capacity for him<end>
<start>i had already read<end>
<start>that is why in nightmares people before the release had already kernels ladies<end>
<start>oh crazy colab<end>
<start>that is why he was mad when he saw that nephis liked shadow<end>
<start>the kind of man i respect<end>
<start>let us goooo i will meet you in a little while i will come read jasminethumbsup<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfuck-fuck-you-middle-finger-middle-finger-gif-<end>
<start>i finished the volume days ago you are not ready to hang on and read well<end>
<start>yes i am starting from the principle that he is just telling him to leave because the rest does not stick too much<end>
<start>what tells us that it is not calculated for something even further in the future<end>
<start>he is got a golmon name too<end>
<start>that is what was serious about the end end or was sunny at the beginning<end>
<start>but good news that one day people will learn about the death of harus and caster<end>
<start>the mortal enemy of singing the fallen<end>
<start>plus it is a dangerous area he can go make shadow fragments down<end>
<start>ah but not<end>
<start>well he can tjr recover fragments of mdrr shadow<end>
<start>we had romance cultivation<end>
<start>my personal theory is the creation of a mini clan under the protection of asterion<end>
<start>because the shop is physical<end>
<start>unless the mistress of the beasts is the divine of the song<end>
<start>thank you sovereign gray<end>
<start>even though he had some luciditis left he would stay crazy so i think it is all over<end>
<start>after i confess i do not have too much opinion on it because we have seen that sunny's defect still works but the other defects like kai's that have external interactions we have not seen yet if they are still effective<end>
<start>or you are the one making up<end>
<start>if he really read that means he is reading wrong<end>
<start>yeah it could have been but dragon i think it is okay with him too<end>
<start>thank you for the chap<end>
<start>but the sovereigns seem to have terrifying powers i really wonder how powerful a ruler with a divine aspect will be<end>
<start>for me in the cohort it will surprise me that they will all pass supreme it will surprise me even bcm<end>
<start>at the level of the exit lege i do not think that domain can coexist however if we have the way out of the equation we have the proof that this march nephis could build its foundations through the domains of singing and speech<end>
<start>why not even yeah if in real life it would be a shame for rain that would probably be much stronger than that<end>
<start>it is so fake ptdrrrr<end>
<start>when she wakes up overnight they will not understand<end>
<start>i swear to her i hate not knowing<end>
<start>so lucky she does not have it<end>
<start>literally ptdrr<end>
<start>saying death is eternal rest and all tralala is just an euphemism<end>
<start>without being forcibly hostile<end>
<start>that is what we are saying but at all times nephis is ultra-cheat too<end>
<start>nope we are talking that dcp with the break the chaps is a more present risk than before spoil is going for now to my knowledge it is not the case<end>
<start>i believe you do not listen to them<end>
<start>you just got us a masterclass<end>
<start>the other takes the intelligence of a hair<end>
<start>cc<end>
<start>nan is my bad<end>
<start>for me it is impossible for sunny as a saint to kill the bird thief has the limit to make a pact with him to recover his destiny but kill him not<end>
<start>it is the one that would be the most even to leave instead of someone<end>
<start>do not abuse however<end>
<start>jpense this psq we follow the story of the pdv of sunny which has an ultra rapid progress in comparison to the others<end>
<start>well he is got a shadow step so yes<end>
<start>he was pretty good too<end>
<start>i have just thought but nephis and mortret are able to destroy one or more of their nuclei to do ouf stuff with their aspects you think that sunny will be able to do something like that would be what<end>
<start>thank you batmannnnn<end>
<start>tell me they finally got out of the nightmare<end>
<start>i just do not want to be robbed<end>
<start>well i think i will read lotm next<end>
<start>i took a lot of time to catch him he said no<end>
<start>she does not really know how to bite<end>
<start>they are going to get out of the nightmare<end>
<start>sunny as owner of shadow dance could partially copy the appearance and behavior of a superior beast he studied for a very long time<end>
<start>well how do you explain yourself when a man and a woman love each other<end>
<start>at the beginning i thought it would be quite poetic if ss ended the same flight<end>
<start>catscream lie<end>
<start>so difficult to say<end>
<start>he cannot break it by hand but he believes that the jaw is the most powerful muscle of the human body in grip<end>
<start>ba as we saw with his himself of the future he regrets this decision<end>
<start>the thing<end>
<start>really besause of him the sovereign same loses all credibility<end>
<start>but the little dots in the water are monsters<end>
<start>after that it is one more sunny in the fight<end>
<start>jse chap<end>
<start>yeah first webnovel<end>
<start>yes we get to the climax of nightmare and work but you cannot publish<end>
<start>aiko who must imagine things not possible after the passage of nephis shibalaugh<end>
<start>your betrayal knows no limit mdr how he copies the release shibalaugh<end>
<start>i do not think so much i have another unlikely theory stv<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewnodding-saturday-night-live-yep-yup-yes-gif-<end>
<start>we talk about bcp entity too powerful now and even if they become sovereign i see bad winning without loss so they need to know their default<end>
<start>i did not know about it<end>
<start>o but in this way normal people could free themselves from sovereigns<end>
<start>real it is possible that if<end>
<start>i do not think quasterion has a physical domain and then the guy is still half dead on the moon<end>
<start>sunny daeron<end>
<start>or her writings from the past in case it happens<end>
<start>yeah but if you just make word for word you do not need a translator you take ggl trad and it is okay<end>
<start>will read her<end>
<start>you do good theory<end>
<start>i do not know i have not read yet i am on the last final shibalaugh game<end>
<start>bah she can even have an aspect and attributes<end>
<start>sensational<end>
<start>cassia mastermind<end>
<start>well her would say she is different<end>
<start>there is no source for the info<end>
<start>spoiler is enough not to click they serve for this<end>
<start>i stack chapters has melted since the same nightmare of the blow i did not read the conv spoil but jespere that there is something to put under the tooth<end>
<start>already we have no idea what cassie knows<end>
<start>knowing that she knows more than well the existence of the suverrain and the fact that even for saints it is impossible to oppose them<end>
<start>it did not have to be that the memories and the tests had to be a lot but the rest i do not know<end>
<start>we know that the earth is the last infecting world but yet the spawned outlight on the moon<end>
<start>never of life it touches him<end>
<start>lo<end>
<start>after sunny and neph was not to the max of their potential unlike now<end>
<start>yeah that is it and why not julus the sunny teacher he could bring his knowledge together to protect them<end>
<start>i know what you mean<end>
<start>depends on the tyrant<end>
<start>the well of wishes<end>
<start>but would he really have been happy having gone half around<end>
<start>i guessed for the sybile echo<end>
<start>ah it is asterion<end>
<start>ptdrr it gets sunny with rain mdr<end>
<start>nan but vrm i think neph just traumatized aiko<end>
<start>in fact if g made sure that sunny was created a connection with every member of the cohort it will not surprise me that he became an ultra fan boy of nightingale<end>
<start>it does not count the people of dusk we agree<end>
<start>it can be the best decision of the work as the worst<end>
<start>httpsworld-novelfrnovelshadow-slave team i was reading normal it is normal that shadow slave is more on the site<end>
<start>in any case not the high members who rule is why they made him knight<end>
<start>i would do it when it is too basic<end>
<start>reaction hat cbpray<end>
<start>it is against the policy of the server and the site so thank you for not reitering your comments emiliahappy<end>
<start>but yes in any way the answer cannot be that we will see later as for cassy<end>
<start>you do not want to see chuck norris he is the one who drew the tapestry of destiny<end>
<start>yeah the problem is its transcendent capacity will probably be more complex than a transfo frame<end>
<start>and you see that - years his passing in big mode elispe<end>
<start>it is very novel of cultivation<end>
<start>yes wide<end>
<start>stop telling me that<end>
<start>song a bit so they won biased<end>
<start>me too but too teube for ss<end>
<start>jespere he will write chapters<end>
<start>yeah that is right now the nephis must think he is dead<end>
<start>vibrant breakie again csais the guy who acts the wrong chap<end>
<start>nan his will ston me<end>
<start>kai boss<end>
<start>much harder<end>
<start>mordret is more intelligent and highly experienced<end>
<start>better<end>
<start>but anyway yeah i think it would be good enough for her<end>
<start>existential question<end>
<start>i think it depends on the sovereign it is like the transfo<end>
<start>cassie said he would get fatless<end>
<start>i am not up to date i still have chap to read<end>
<start>and if they come out in x time<end>
<start>imagine that the three sovereigns did not actually kill the father of nephis and that if anvil wanted to kill nephis it was because he was afraid of her<end>
<start>level reading you do what you want i do not care but do not come to talk about the fact that you read in english it is disrespectful for my work and by pitie stop saying that you know something shut up<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewugly-duckling-crying-ducks-gif-<end>
<start>the tradition of what mdr<end>
<start>the little soldier who became sleeping in the volume<end>
<start>and descend from a class<end>
<start>i just stopped<end>
<start>guys i have a question for you think that the same jet capacity that allows her to improve her kernel of stars is what her a definite improvement or is what her temporary kind she loses him small at small if she does not keep killing like for her ecsence of being<end>
<start>for me the fragment would remain in place<end>
<start>that we know from the point of view of nether but ptet that he lost her precisely has become nothing<end>
<start>i forgot<end>
<start>um i forgot about existence<end>
<start>dead in the nightmare<end>
<start>she is not my wife for nothing<end>
<start>so the sunny has no one to manage<end>
<start>i am at the same time as you in the serv<end>
<start>stay on positive<end>
<start>or something<end>
<start>then i do not think he is sleeping<end>
<start>but then i am going to discover the pain of waiting for chapters every day with the new trend to change narrator i feel it will be painful at the beginning<end>
<start>so special<end>
<start>that is the one that came out a while ago<end>
<start>the others have their destiny<end>
<start>i am tired of laughing at every volume<end>
<start>the identity of the god is specified in this chapter<end>
<start>i was trying to remember my rereading<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewamericas-got-talent-agt-happy-smile-excited-gif-<end>
<start>then he betrayed her too<end>
<start>thanks guys i am at it<end>
<start>when nephis will realize what kind of personality likes the same guy ptdrrrr<end>
<start>there is a great chance but that it is a shorter volume of transition instead of the genre chaps<end>
<start>gigachad<end>
<start>like i really cannot know who is going to win<end>
<start>and if she asks him he will just tell him i am thinking<end>
<start>more logical<end>
<start>and then i am in regular contact with him so it is okay we get along well and he is glad it is trad en fr<end>
<start>you have no more information than that<end>
<start>the worst would be kai<end>
<start>weaver the sdf i do not know who said that here and that i saw passing but it is hilarious<end>
<start>it means that during the battle he was in the same rank<end>
<start>or i started the volume a little weird the atmosphere<end>
<start>change yourself too<end>
<start>we will have gone around<end>
<start>cassie was the mirror<end>
<start>the one who had not changed is lost<end>
<start>ah<end>
<start>no matter what happens<end>
<start>how it goes with the ship of the god of shadow so he was not neutralized by the line of weaver<end>
<start>they get to devnier a little while trying but that is all<end>
<start>it is not necessarily creating one but finding it after i do not know if it is something that appears when you get your look or if it is something that is been anchored in you since the beginning of your life<end>
<start>he is going to fuck up so much everywhere<end>
<start>eurys is not immortal it was the tree that had to make him intuable and go see chap he does not seem to talk about a metaphoric kingdom<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewelmo-shrug-i-do not-know-gif-<end>
<start>the more opportunities there are to create wakes<end>
<start>and especially the mask makes itself meditable<end>
<start>it must be the only master in history who killed one<end>
<start>what does that mean<end>
<start>but there have already been spoils especially because of the same republished g server<end>
<start>the fate is of unbreakable threads<end>
<start>ba her team casi with a savrerain even if c to betray him after<end>
<start>es what can be said that sunny is schizofrene disorder of personnalitis a because of his clones since when he saw a changing star the truth he did not talk to him about his body but he told him that they were all he<end>
<start>the expression having butterfly in the belly should be enough for sunny<end>
<start>i do not know how to describe what i felt x<end>
<start>that is exactly it<end>
<start>i do not think so either<end>
<start>yeah after that masterclass remains this bow that is on<end>
<start>bam team of saints<end>
<start>finally the dream<end>
<start>the beginning of the flashback on the shore was too long in real life<end>
<start>the best person for now c on<end>
<start>this is the syou are of his brother shibalaugh<end>
<start>hey buddy<end>
<start>so glad to have decided to wait for the gray trade to live this from the best possible manners<end>
<start>if you choose<end>
<start>that is exactly the trace i made ahaha<end>
<start>i believe i have never had a bitter feeling empty admiring so loud by reading a work mdr that is what this end that hurts the heart<end>
<start>unclean beast<end>
<start>the world of dreams is not dependent on the sortlege<end>
<start>you are going to get a shibalaugh body weapon<end>
<start>bah the question is what she will have the line of the god of the shadow too<end>
<start>i did not think it was so much for that<end>
<start>i am not even here by royal order<end>
<start>a little early even if it was short<end>
<start>what is wrong since his desire to fight against destiny comes precisely from the condition of sunny<end>
<start>the avatar of groove walks<end>
<start>they have public opinion in addition<end>
<start>o i think he goes spawn but not with naeve<end>
<start>in real sunny he has cmb de qi in your opinion for me his brain he must be enormous with clones and the sense of shadow<end>
<start>but honestly the real world will look like what in the dream realm<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewscreening-afraid-kevin-hart-gif-<end>
<start>beautiful image nempeche<end>
<start>otherwise the existence of the creations of the neant is perfect to add challenge because if the cohort can already take care of titan superior they have almost finished the game with this new level of enemies it will be incredible<end>
<start>that means he went to see every daemon leaving a trace there<end>
<start>mdr on the chap it is the mother of cassia who spells it<end>
<start>difficult to say the concept of real name is rather mysterious since the beginning of the work<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfrankt-gif-<end>
<start>class<end>
<start>or whispering blade<end>
<start>yeah i prefer to do like that too<end>
<start>and you will see why i said this<end>
<start>reverence the nightmare of the god forgets<end>
<start>he can only become what he was not before<end>
<start>the immortal flame was not the immortal flame before having the sun's line<end>
<start>the volume i do not know for me the volume is the best and far the whole construction of the nightmare is crazy really and for me the volume is above forgetten shore the thing that decy or it is the end for me this is the end for me it is the end of the bad manner sunny come back only a week after it enters into the nightmare the manner do not it has been taken away its destiny i find it basic let us say that i expected a great release that would come to rewrite this or that it would break its same same or that it would have to destroy it itself by cutting off its sons not 'just a piaf that comes to pick up its sons of destiny then pouf' it is coarse but that is like this that i did not feel it again i did not feel it as much hype that the rest of you just think about this part the side or all the world has forgotten it can be logical after that its sons have been in it is way hers and it is going to get a little bit out of it and it is a bit of it is a bit of it is a bit of it is a bit of it is a bit<end>
<start>both<end>
<start>the reaction of kai too<end>
<start>it is either the relatively distant future like years<end>
<start>what do i love him<end>
<start>whatever you want<end>
<start>he was probably more than sovereign too<end>
<start>not right away<end>
<start>gray what goat<end>
<start>nah<end>
<start>continues to read<end>
<start>i see one coming but i would not mention it<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>haste to see pop the top sovereign in this channel to react to history shibalaugh<end>
<start>and the names of the enchantments too i think<end>
<start>welcome to the team<end>
<start>it is in the temporalite or it makes a point with the newly acquired temple<end>
<start>or jsp in fact<end>
<start>you self-proclaimed you were not there at creation<end>
<start>irreplaceable<end>
<start>but not that he knows how to use it<end>
<start>like on the moon he would have found a door of the level nightmares and would have passed sacre then would have included the moon in his domain<end>
<start>i am a<end>
<start>for me c impossible than holy cane because it is connected to nether<end>
<start>let me see more we never know the enchantment was on one nucleus<end>
<start>thanks for the chaps<end>
<start>oh<end>
<start>he is just a mile away<end>
<start>fuck the mind you have got the volume ended<end>
<start>she did her thing to give back the choice to sunny that she had taken away from her<end>
<start>they are not sure they believe it and then i am surprised they will accept it<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewslimkatj-slimkat-slimmekat-gif-<end>
<start>he is been spawning in space after his nightmare to pass sacred<end>
<start>well if she knew<end>
<start>pepewow<end>
<start>already that i think it has to discover the true meaning of death because death is not the same thing that we think in slavic shadow and sunny has to discover the real meaning of it and i think snake will help over it<end>
<start>so about year and a half<end>
<start>well it is still blurry but it is done expres i guess<end>
<start>then it is not crazy for his business if he tries a master who manages to resist the edge of one of the strongest saints<end>
<start>bah sunny is one of the strongest saints in the world not<end>
<start>like it is too much<end>
<start>i admit that i think the shadows i do not give a shit about being in mode oh bah shame and i would continue the chap ptdrrrrrrr<end>
<start>just the people on the shore forget<end>
<start>there is still a year of blur before he gets back into the real world<end>
<start>mtn that you notice it is true that it is bzr<end>
<start>there was a category door<end>
<start>or you read that the chaps en fr like you do not have the problem<end>
<start>the only thing he keeps is the stuff he changed himself<end>
<start>because sunny would kill nephis<end>
<start>she is just being barked by any member of the current hood<end>
<start>i pray with you<end>
<start>maybe not forget that the others are genies just as much to see more than he is<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewpolska-poland-minecraft-torch-creaper-gif-<end>
<start>i find the excuse of vaccination a little simple i expected at least a little complication when reading the runes<end>
<start>wow sacre chapter<end>
<start>yeah it is true it is tense for you to talk to me when you have a lot more info mdrr<end>
<start>while he is very much seen how the titan superieur was described you think that sunny could have beaten him<end>
<start>but yes i see what you mean if sunny and neph pass over to egal estate they get eaten<end>
<start>your malus allows him to recover fragments and strengthen and get enough to make his nephi memories<end>
<start>okay for me the bird ripped off the exit leg the fate that took away his real name and took away who connect him to the world<end>
<start>bah in real life the six wounds will not be the right one so he could cross daeron<end>
<start>i almost<end>
<start>doing justice to me without reason<end>
<start>thanks for bg chaps<end>
<start>so i am currently in the chapter where sunny is arriving at the eastern quadrant of lantarctic it finds neph cass effie and kai in the ivory tower etc in short at present i know that the great clan will confront each other to lighten their domain the term is still blurred enough for me even with the explanation of neph<end>
<start>ah if it is okay<end>
<start>her makes me ask her a question<end>
<start>the savannah<end>
<start>and i am in a hurry to see the sunny snuff<end>
<start>yeah it is the clan of the night that has the line of the god of the temple<end>
<start>yeah but why would she own the mtn line<end>
<start>i think it deserves at least one calin<end>
<start>httpssoundcloudcomgriffintylerlord-of-shadowssibffadcbdcfacutmsourceclipboardutmmediumtextutmcampaignsocialshare<end>
<start>he did not go alone<end>
<start>i understood it correctly i said fatally that it falls not in a hollow period but on the contrary<end>
<start>if sunny had to show up from him even though he was on the shore forgets with the others they forget but by making a breakie understand that he was there thanks to his memories it passes and there is no forgetting<end>
<start>o not wrong with the suns<end>
<start>maybe it is me who deceives me about the person is either one of the sleepers or one of the seishan maids<end>
<start>mrc gray for chaps<end>
<start>asterion has no divine aspect nor the padre of neph<end>
<start>and the other one i forgot<end>
<start>i did not even know the author was a western lol<end>
<start>what is his point<end>
<start>nice play<end>
<start>and on top with a s<end>
<start>the worst thing you have ever found is a bunch of daeron-like beasts<end>
<start>i already had the same problem with a reader in the site reviews<end>
<start>without his real name it is going to be complicated in any way to get better<end>
<start>he smoked on the other hand sunny<end>
<start>how the essence of soul circulates in the body<end>
<start>they are down drinking a the they resound the pass especially ro and neph says it was nice<end>
<start>at the same time what saint is not strong in his<end>
<start>i surpassed myself this time<end>
<start>jsp if there are other holy spe full physical<end>
<start>and he is right emiliahappy<end>
<start>i forced tbate i gave up chief<end>
<start>mordret are goal in life is to make shit valor impossible that they do not come shibalaugh<end>
<start>i think he is losing fights<end>
<start>i think we can even say he is a tripolar with the shibalaughrain teacher<end>
<start>but cassie she wrote all these adventures in these newspapers and therefore for sure of sunny and if she could not remember or other but that these newspapers become the memory which lost<end>
<start>and even in battle with a weapon<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewdo-over-reset-button-gif-<end>
<start>ahlalala g will one day have my heart<end>
<start>cogitis<end>
<start>when you have to be old<end>
<start>i am moving ahead mdrr<end>
<start>a response in the next chapter<end>
<start>if we follow the logic it would be sleeper lvl awaken lvl master lvl saint lvl what sovereign chance lvl<end>
<start>you think it is his domain i thought that only asterion could move him<end>
<start>i do not think they are just talking about war<end>
<start>braille pq<end>
<start>i think so too<end>
<start>well i just find that saying that makes the rank of saint more clear when even<end>
<start>imagine on all the epee are like superior in terms of power and there is a rain of its that falls to you dessu<end>
<start>at this rate the work is finished within years it is square<end>
<start>i thought it was the cyou are ptet i confused with asterion<end>
<start>the plot twist on cassie wow<end>
<start>nightmare is a shadow to what i know a shadow can stink less than a rock<end>
<start>yeah maybe soon<end>
<start>so his only way out of the desert is the seed<end>
<start>but a sovereign walking around the real world<end>
<start>a form of immortality<end>
<start>genre tt the keeper of fire with the mark a boost of nephis jsp which for now<end>
<start>fielon on top<end>
<start>rhetoric question catscream<end>
<start>blc<end>
<start>he is going to get his ass saved by nephis and the guy's going to be a lucas wykes<end>
<start>not at all shibalaugh<end>
<start>because we see that there is already bcq relationship between weaver and the shadow god so kind of crossed their lines would explain things<end>
<start>it is like eating a she will of a turtle that ranks higher than him<end>
<start>yesterday there was<end>
<start>then if you succeed in reaching a bridge while sleeping you become a wake<end>
<start>probably not by the way<end>
<start>average<end>
<start>i lied at the end is super funny too<end>
<start>and the hollows are full of beasts<end>
<start>tomorrow we will probably know the more sah i have had<end>
<start>i confess your cock<end>
<start>you saw the old name you had<end>
<start>he had just written in advance<end>
<start>for unclean creatures<end>
<start>no idea will see for yourself<end>
<start>mmhhh i think it fits very well perso<end>
<start>i remembered it just before you said it xd<end>
<start>fuck the appearance of the same god at last<end>
<start>to know if sunny shows a nephis caster via her soul snake she will forget everything or she will be able to create a link between the two<end>
<start>i do not have the names but i know some people are not here<end>
<start>groove awakens and beginning of war i think<end>
<start>they will still be small<end>
<start>and the father of brass he did not say he was going back between the song and the sword<end>
<start>maybe he will be able to experiment with evolutive memories on a groove as he knows his abilities well to do a test before starting to create the nephis<end>
<start>well i have just come from or even my syou are reading slavic shadow without me forcing my work is over<end>
<start>his whole power is not to see the future<end>
<start>and said that i planned to let go at least a few months<end>
<start>all right<end>
<start>mortret its corrupt version is goatesque<end>
<start>when it must be something dared huh<end>
<start>cassie who is going to make an avc when she is going to see that he left just for this<end>
<start>i know your question<end>
<start>it is stupid to say that the characters are already written and developed they will not serve the relationship<end>
<start>when she says oh should buy new furniture while she finds her dress at sunny's<end>
<start>just bite can stay in the bodies nn<end>
<start>morgan who is going to feel stupid when she is going to understand that the echo has stung the level of a real saint<end>
<start>and weaver is uncertain<end>
<start>they have to put on flashlights so that there are no zombies who spawn at their house shibalaugh<end>
<start>because really<end>
<start>for now we have had three divine aspects it would be a shame we do not have the others<end>
<start>she already feels it without being able to use it is a good start<end>
<start>same problem here catscream<end>
<start>i took a break in reading<end>
<start>but effie has a kid that the others should be educated while knowing that her mother died with a sunny<end>
<start>so he is no longer in the carpetery of destiny<end>
<start>oh no<end>
<start>but nothing understands what he has to do<end>
<start>if i believe what said they should wake up their appearance<end>
<start>he is in front of his ribbon<end>
<start>it is true but you never know<end>
<start>it is just as funny as shibalaugh<end>
<start>damnation here come condemnation<end>
<start>he said it<end>
<start>cassie i think<end>
<start>and more<end>
<start>good question<end>
<start>likely outcome<end>
<start>in real c possibility that this situation comes first down his kills me<end>
<start>i think he will be like his<end>
<start>impossible<end>
<start>yeah it is the positive side that makes me want to get there<end>
<start>and it must probably be that<end>
<start>especially given the one he got<end>
<start>frankly do not take your head with it even if it is the case you can continue with their agreement it is the most important thing even if we have got chapters of delay<end>
<start>i am an asshole<end>
<start>yes and yet sunny was that a master when he sent his memory right into his mouth cbpray it is loud i do not say otherwise but compares class and rank it is crazy how great the difference is between the two<end>
<start>i do not believe you<end>
<start>that he regrets having abandoned everyone like a dung<end>
<start>nan tiquietee the heart fight should be enough for me to wait<end>
<start>by the time the flight is over<end>
<start>you see more fielon or saint cane<end>
<start>after he invokes his avatar he cannot increase it is not necessarily top<end>
<start>so no one can touch them physically<end>
<start>i hope it will not become the volume of incoherence<end>
<start>especially as they will have the masters of the shore forget with them<end>
<start>yes it will be the most logical<end>
<start>jespere the beginning of the fight<end>
<start>i will find it a little stupid from him<end>
<start>a little like the sun of the shore forgets oe<end>
<start>crazy their new beginning<end>
<start>made me a little pinch at the cyou are tata cassie uncle kai<end>
<start>because it would surprise me that g mtn developments<end>
<start>not because mongrel was connecting to sunny for the cohort members<end>
<start>i do not think vrm<end>
<start>it was a sin of loneliness<end>
<start>on<end>
<start>valor will not kill him<end>
<start>you know you are the one who expects you to reward all his efforts all the proofs you have had from sunny we want the comfort after the effort then boom he puts on the slap that finishes you emotionally mdr<end>
<start>t on i understood his rank<end>
<start>shit i have got his identity<end>
<start>lambdas wakes cannot read the chainings of memories it was a speciality of sunny i have a doubt<end>
<start>because in reality ok cassie is hyper intelligent but from the a that a simple awaken can break fate like that while the gods ny does not even happen no weaver has necessarily done something<end>
<start>i had the same idea two weeks ago xd i am at the end of the same nightmare<end>
<start>understand it probably do not blame him so much it is another story<end>
<start>at song at suare valor after the wiki<end>
<start>i do not think it is end right now i do not see it that way but it could be<end>
<start>her thing turned against him at one guy he is a two-packer so you got nothing in itself<end>
<start>sorry friends i change supremacy<end>
<start>in real life i kiff the period slice of life between the period of action because if we had that action again and again it would be a bit boring i find<end>
<start>especially that sunny has the support of morgan<end>
<start>ah but the<end>
<start>one feels the feelings of both parties perfectly to my mind<end>
<start>ptet that he has like sunny another line<end>
<start>well i think it is going to have an impact after<end>
<start>save<end>
<start>for me it makes sense that she talks about nephis or cassia in this sense<end>
<start>i feel like i have read cassia honestly<end>
<start>i do not remember what he said but he seems extremely plausible<end>
<start>nan really this volume too tight<end>
<start>even if we do not know much<end>
<start>do not even mention that to me<end>
<start>cool<end>
<start>in addition to the consideration of how jet galere alone it must be complicated that fighting superior creatures alone and as said above they are often separated<end>
<start>in sao<end>
<start>he squeezes you in a way<end>
<start>i am finally up to date<end>
<start>gray you do not want to threaten g so he gets us out chapters please<end>
<start>she must have a little chat with her best friend<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewspeed-i-am-speed-lightning-mcqueen-cars-meme-gif-<end>
<start>and nothing tells us that everything is not calculated since the beginning<end>
<start>piper<end>
<start>i do not know what i am thinking<end>
<start>may be that they have a kind of infinite growth<end>
<start>they have aspects of tare too<end>
<start>if he met a licre with an aspect of water his authority would more for example walk<end>
<start>she just had a heritage<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewtangled-courage-courage-the-cowardly-dog-knotted-tied-in-yarn-gif-<end>
<start>after the worst there is a sunny chef who comes out of the shadow and who one shot<end>
<start>kai can confirm what you think is true<end>
<start>goddamn it is as strong as the bird that stole the destiny of sunny<end>
<start>we cannot help you anymore<end>
<start>ah man jespere he is getting off here yen will be more xd<end>
<start>only minor gods<end>
<start>i mean that is what i think i understand<end>
<start>i do not have anything yet but if i find anything say<end>
<start>sunny is a divine shadow and nephis a light being<end>
<start>either she is infected with no<end>
<start>he just says it after the fight between nephis and shadow<end>
<start>may be neph<end>
<start>he already talked about it at some point he wondered what would happen if he passed the mask to different people do not jet and it is like axel said dcp<end>
<start>he had no body during his first encounter with sunny<end>
<start>the technique is effective shibalaugh<end>
<start>and the eggs you remember after neph freed skeletons in the cursed desert<end>
<start>i want to know<end>
<start>i save my theory dcp it can serve<end>
<start>ephie who will want a sunny for her<end>
<start>good courage to him<end>
<start>it is easy to read that is what is good<end>
<start>if wait<end>
<start>it is a corner system<end>
<start>i had a break on vo mtn i am finally up to date that on your trade<end>
<start>shadows devour light<end>
<start>it is human<end>
<start>in real life what happens if efface dies the medaillon disappears or not i know more if the heritage disappears<end>
<start>ah damage<end>
<start>actually i think that sunny does the same when he had to create shadows he splits up some of his fragments from the shadow like nephis when she uses against the cursed tyrant but i think he could do more like without the sortlege that provides him with an echo but the sound still a thing on which he has to work as he did for the mimic<end>
<start>yes he is very afraid already when one has seen the robber and he could bite as a saint and who has all his head should be monstrous especially if he can dream even more powerful creatures than before<end>
<start>it is complicated to say in real life i read it so long ago the shore forgets that there is a nostalgic part that fakes the thing would take me to reread it to know<end>
<start>we know that becoming a merchant is one of his dreams but in that sense the really shibalaugh<end>
<start>ahuhtao<end>
<start>yes me<end>
<start>i do not think i understand<end>
<start>c true i saw it avoids the mirrors i immediately think a mordret who lives in this area<end>
<start>so be yes as long as the sovereign does not agree the seed cannot eclore but they have no authority on the seed directly just they have the authority on your exit<end>
<start>let us cry together<end>
<start>you read yesterday's chaps or how it goes<end>
<start>i do not remember<end>
<start>yep jvenes to check<end>
<start>bg your pdp and banished<end>
<start>imagine sunny asks to reverse the relationship and it is he who becomes the master laughs<end>
<start>even i need the rest of the birthday<end>
<start>it is like weaver has predicted that sunny would do it<end>
<start>or probably according to the outputs that g predicted this day if the free chapters come out it will be otherwise the<end>
<start>i do not think he is going to ask i want to be free to the personal fountain like i do not see him reflecting on what to mark the crazy prince<end>
<start>this day is finally coming<end>
<start>okay that works thanks<end>
<start>i think it is too simple<end>
<start>wait waiting<end>
<start>at the entrance of the same hoodie says brave would we not finally have the answer of the number of resets he made there<end>
<start>and as she understood that there was an anomaly with sunny she made the connection that sunny anomaly<end>
<start>not included<end>
<start>i hope it will not become a problem later<end>
<start>by contrast style that it is in part<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewdc-bh-batman-coming-gif-<end>
<start>go read and you will know emiliahappy<end>
<start>he told her to go out if she is in danger<end>
<start>ptdrrr i have been on my way to paint<end>
<start>more than nephis<end>
<start>he has the temple line<end>
<start>yes but the sunny will want revenge<end>
<start>jy is<end>
<start>no i am talking about his master's ability<end>
<start>in real life there are even times really crazy<end>
<start>especially with an old mess like you pepecry<end>
<start>that is exactly what i thought<end>
<start>that is the thing it really does that hop hit it is right by slamming fingers<end>
<start>httpswwwinstagramcompcjkyxshpuigshmtazmbzdtyxawudgdd<end>
<start>whatever<end>
<start>after that it is not going to lick probably amplify and strengthen its shadows<end>
<start>that sunny did not happen to remember his name that he asked once<end>
<start>that is why he stays in a dragon<end>
<start>ah yes c true he says rain needs better fleche javai skip his<end>
<start>yeah he can be pretty good<end>
<start>you are gone<end>
<start>i am at the mwa<end>
<start>me<end>
<start>i have got too much to follow<end>
<start>we see him with morgan who for me and bcq of people has no divine aspect unlike his brother<end>
<start>jsp i am having a hard time getting a nice break actually<end>
<start>you have taken a pitite too<end>
<start>not me<end>
<start>sunny he will really end up pecho cassie<end>
<start>we are going to get along nicely here hehe<end>
<start>it is not because he has memory and everything he has<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthat is-huge-enormous-that is-big-huge-linus-gif-<end>
<start>yeah he is not titan or terror then<end>
<start>my only memory of passing on her is that he has a shadow that constantly monitors her a little bit of bizzar<end>
<start>there is nothing weird we just do not know what is going on after the titan<end>
<start>people are crazy<end>
<start>i had time to lose with my driving hours<end>
<start>especially as i have already thought about it but he should have done it on the flying island<end>
<start>know that my head will find it on time for a while i will cook something and put my mind in order and i will come back<end>
<start>because he is conscious enough to improve without the mad prince was also but less<end>
<start>even do not need to squeeze me gray has a vacation in the end everyone is happy<end>
<start>in chained island<end>
<start>it would be more like a knife behind her back<end>
<start>i find the just a little abuse because it takes when even building the story around<end>
<start>and your theory with the lantern that contains the whole domain of the shadow it is not stupid<end>
<start>not bad on<end>
<start>how its<end>
<start>nan but the mad prince<end>
<start>seeing that he slipped his avatar before she came home<end>
<start>he is going to be like this<end>
<start>now so on amazon<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewhammaya-relaxed-relax-mr-bean-gif-gif-<end>
<start>so rain will not get the weaver line so if she has the shade line she will keep it<end>
<start>what are you doing<end>
<start>may be the runes that were applied to the wall and i imagine the tools that we do not peri after sunny is open<end>
<start>i think not after jsp since it is not really sunny and then she never made the rapprochement between saint and sunny<end>
<start>small reminder it was forbidden by the government to continue studying the moon because it was too dangerous we finally have the answer the danger is to see a guy quietly floating in space<end>
<start>if it counts those entering the seed it counts in million resets<end>
<start>he comes into the same nightmare<end>
<start>no appearance or defect<end>
<start>i forgot<end>
<start>this is the youngest in the group<end>
<start>superature<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewrotisserie-chicken-spinning-food-roast-gif-<end>
<start>after about chapters finally the return of the shore forgets<end>
<start>jsp jcrois eh<end>
<start>stack it<end>
<start>in the end sunny is free and there has been no death that demands more<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfeel-me-think-about-it-me-gif-<end>
<start>i think fighting corrupt people is enough<end>
<start>but it is not going to give her the same thing<end>
<start>i have been doing it again<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewreally-oh-now-stare-glare-side-eye-gif-<end>
<start>a superior tyrant makes swarms of corrupt creatures<end>
<start>thanks the gray<end>
<start>with some fights by if by the<end>
<start>i had zape<end>
<start>a nice return of baton<end>
<start>you have got a baby on the ceiling<end>
<start>you want a cohort fight with each other's role<end>
<start>i am a curse i am always close<end>
<start>but i really expected serious that nephis and cassia would be happy that he had to live<end>
<start>from saint to supreme the difference will be or times greater than master to saint<end>
<start>so that is why i got confused<end>
<start>dream god<end>
<start>i think it is pretty much a metaphore while remaining true lu-dela is the shadow realm so to eurys looking for it is finding a way to die<end>
<start>with the dance of shadows his class i believe and his rank with the rank of sunny<end>
<start>the main event is over but it is true that it is a pretty brutal ending<end>
<start>wait for the snake can accompany groove in his nightmare you think<end>
<start>goat<end>
<start>only if they can send the memory back to their soul<end>
<start>a shibalaugh hair<end>
<start>we have been saying it for months<end>
<start>thank you boss<end>
<start>may be<end>
<start>in itself with the distance their connection can be temporarily interrupted as when he left in antarctica it was impossible for him to control to call him<end>
<start>i am on the rls<end>
<start>good the most classic thing i could think of is a rarignee with the same title as weaver<end>
<start>off<end>
<start>the person is too ambitious to die here<end>
<start>honestly the nephis sunny dialogues were just amazing for me<end>
<start>snake is always a transcendent terror<end>
<start>pregnant in terminal phase in a fight against the first seeker<end>
<start>after what i know it might be stronger than ki and valor because he would have protected nephis when she was small<end>
<start>it was not raining so often or so often<end>
<start>yep i see but who knows it could have been extremely well dev<end>
<start>it is from what volume it returns to the world i am in volume<end>
<start>but it says in which chapter that because really i have absolutely no memory<end>
<start>but as i have already told me there is a beggar in the cohort if he passes the sovereign i swear he will be too scared<end>
<start>i am not sure he really likes his shibalaugh epees because he is really making it at the chain like a mdr factory<end>
<start>domain of the soul all those who have a soul are part of his domain nephis<end>
<start>yeah but for the answers but just as a basic sign it must be okay<end>
<start>ah nan it is just because there is no air it is trql in the space vacuum watching what is happening<end>
<start>yen too much is getting weird<end>
<start>major sunless died in battle the devil of the antarctic is a symbol of the collective will the aiko memory provider disappeared probably dead in antarctica<end>
<start>harper<end>
<start>the house of the night has the temple line<end>
<start>i looked when they mentioned all the most powerful creatures in the center of the antarctic and not found ptn<end>
<start>we agree that everyone can see the enchantment of their memory or that it is that sunny thanks to the dichor drop that can<end>
<start>because cassie said it would only work for sunny<end>
<start>it was so crazy<end>
<start>will sunny ever reach the level of the mad prince in the dark dance even because without his real name it is complicated to move forward<end>
<start>ho<end>
<start>o i do not see or he said<end>
<start>it would be fun for his estate to give him a master and to get a master he needs a real name<end>
<start>i could not get out the chaps it is about the time of the estuary but weaver is the only daemon who made a line<end>
<start>already that anvil was having trouble with a wake-up bite<end>
<start>ouuuuhhhh<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewcest-true-gif-<end>
<start>since wounds are the future and not the pass<end>
<start>for chap man<end>
<start>i really held that the essential<end>
<start>he just has to kill something that has managed to fly weaver simple as hello<end>
<start>and i have to wait foreeeeee catscream<end>
<start>i was going to piss my head off<end>
<start>because luf on the shore forgets you cannot say he was super powerful shibalaugh<end>
<start>thanks gray for chaps<end>
<start>jthinks also that mordret and sunny will eventually become<end>
<start>it is my pref volume too<end>
<start>skull<end>
<start>that is just how she understood<end>
<start>their interaction is to die of laughter<end>
<start>the great river is a loop the sunny of the future is not the sunny of the future and i pass and i pass<end>
<start>shipping or transfo<end>
<start>ha thin it seemed to me to have voted for something or you had to put some names of characters sorry<end>
<start>i am not spoiling<end>
<start>i am leaving catscream<end>
<start>you will see too<end>
<start>we started talking about it here there must be some messages a little lower<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewits-training-rain-gif-<end>
<start>it works like a bite except he does not need to destroy a core<end>
<start>the chaps of kisses cassia mastermind one of the best persono of loooooiiiinn<end>
<start>if he would gone half way around he could not have been really happy with nephis what is a little contrary to his goal<end>
<start>jsp but i am convinced that this little detail lvl door probably says that asterion has a divine aspect<end>
<start>this dung of g a change of direct pov in addition to me jvou la suite<end>
<start>for now the only known prohibition line is weaver's and i do not think there will be any more<end>
<start>plus morgan does not look interested she already broke her heart literally<end>
<start>we know that from example mordert has inherited from his divine line but his does not mean that the sight of his father is divine if his is located they just possess the line of the god and she would have its appearance otherwise<end>
<start>i am sure that even g does not know why he put that shibalaugh<end>
<start>neph and sunny have so much cliche behavior when they think about the other shibalaugh<end>
<start>it was a shame<end>
<start>not me too i love the change of pov its gives so much more impact to work<end>
<start>in any case she will not get pregnant just before a nightmare she<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbatman-bat-signal-gif-<end>
<start>whataa you have been able to read it in minutes<end>
<start>that is how it feels right now<end>
<start>yep everyone has his version of the thing to stick to the universe he represents himself<end>
<start>surpassing them even<end>
<start>and at the same time the logic of time and loops are broken head<end>
<start>it would be cool if it were born<end>
<start>just the nightmare ends more or less or please so i know when to stop thank you<end>
<start>it has been useful this bond of shadow<end>
<start>personal i would have taken advantage of being on anemone to see what it feels like to lose a happy shadow drowsy a holy shadow ptere fielon even look at the tapestry of destiny but it would be like masochism at a time when mm<end>
<start>oh king's ref<end>
<start>for the last chapters of the volume i think<end>
<start>with eyes<end>
<start>jet that will finally pass holy because it makes a good time for her<end>
<start>bah the test jles see as a very hard training to try to train future fighters<end>
<start>but i did not say anything<end>
<start>the latter<end>
<start>but i do not understand if cassie cannot detect sunny it is because of the fragments of the mask because otherwise she can make the rapprochement with the bartender sunny and the mask does not remind them either<end>
<start>even on because the seventh must not have a line<end>
<start>but in real life it is not serious nephis the almost well taken shibalaugh<end>
<start>well play expensive st pray<end>
<start>but just not because i was talking about the cohort<end>
<start>i do not know what a sunny vision was telling everyone<end>
<start>knowledge<end>
<start>for me jets is clearly the most powerful<end>
<start>it is good to be quick<end>
<start>asterion manipulates spirits in the way of lo terror<end>
<start>or else be able to copy more complex transfos like noctis<end>
<start>as long as it is the half-highest it should<end>
<start>all v is all time mtn jy reflects<end>
<start>asterion coming at the end of the war<end>
<start>the mad prince has entered his dreams and he meets with cassie<end>
<start>nan in real life i abuse<end>
<start>i did not ask my friend<end>
<start>we do not pass supreme as i think<end>
<start>i do not think he could have a line that would make the one weaver a little trivial if the other deamons have one i find<end>
<start>and so to get back to a blackcastie there is definitely something her smile weakens a little means that there is something<end>
<start>seeing that no one sees him and he influences the future according to his good will<end>
<start>spoil chapter about<end>
<start>i am in love<end>
<start>sunny became the variable cassie wanted to create<end>
<start>i think pretty much the creations of the nightmare<end>
<start>so yes in real life it could easily beat a knife with preparation<end>
<start>i am rereading antarctic larc and your messages under the chapters please me mdr<end>
<start>that is why i have to respect the release or i am not going to be long<end>
<start>i think the whole volume after that will be focused on this<end>
<start>i swear even weavy scared<end>
<start>but it is in the plans<end>
<start>and above all we tend to forget it but when she is sleepy she is been surveilled by a superior titan on the shore forgets<end>
<start>guys i do not know if i am going to hold on a long time without the ss chaps before i sleep<end>
<start>you assume that c of - - and not of - x -<end>
<start>but we underestimate the complexity of the nephis character<end>
<start>i feel like we have all forgotten this<end>
<start>the bonus we will wait a few dozen years or the chance to fall on the creatures of the shadow<end>
<start>it does matter<end>
<start>but use only the first stages<end>
<start>he just started the war<end>
<start>not yet but one day when i have time<end>
<start>goddamn it i am hype for the sequel<end>
<start>i am stunned<end>
<start>she is so nice frankly<end>
<start>mine<end>
<start>someone has a banished anime ss nice<end>
<start>i am yours but hers<end>
<start>around h generally<end>
<start>mama they are too good chaps<end>
<start>it almost hurts the cyou are<end>
<start>mirrors are too simple<end>
<start>and for me it changes nothing that he lost his destiny<end>
<start>is preparing a metiss mi daemon mi god<end>
<start>he is quite interesting<end>
<start>yes they are stronger than the average it is on<end>
<start>he masteres his fault well enough not to answer the question unless question really direct and then he thinks he spends his time telling him anything<end>
<start>i just think he does not like us getting into his head<end>
<start>fateless is not just his attribute<end>
<start>in aleatory enchantment mode as in minecraft shibalaugh<end>
<start>nan sah thank you gray for this trad<end>
<start>we know he had to pee for the fight for his citadel<end>
<start>good but how he is going to get back those wsh memories<end>
<start>they<end>
<start>good vacation i guess<end>
<start>besides the mountains without names we did not get any new information about the bad location that he recovered the nameless temple<end>
<start>sunny and shadow<end>
<start>they may not be subject to the same law concerning the<end>
<start>okay<end>
<start>well then what is the other thing that got ripped off for you<end>
<start>i swear to god you love the word gargantues which i cannot believe you used words from the old fr elate<end>
<start>for everything in the work is related to the number so if it breaks destiny and dcp has place it ends<end>
<start>thanks tell him<end>
<start>but there was minimal or<end>
<start>the failure to bite is not the reason for the attempt to assassinate his family<end>
<start>thank you good otherwise how you find it volume<end>
<start>for now sunny has heritage of nether she will heritage of weaver weavings fed<end>
<start>there is a connection to this chanel<end>
<start>you must have missed a chapter<end>
<start>azy scales when even<end>
<start>in real life they are based on real myths so you can always search the internet<end>
<start>i think it is my favorite volume in real life<end>
<start>that is how i see things<end>
<start>c true that his can think about it<end>
<start>frankly<end>
<start>difficult to say or will progress groove or how will end story because mtn the world of origin seems to disappear to let the world of nightmares become the new world of humans<end>
<start>at least not yet<end>
<start>oh yeah since she is not sleepy<end>
<start>that sunny escapes from the bond of shadow or that it evolues is for me the best news<end>
<start>no chapters during week jveux cry<end>
<start>what does it grow up<end>
<start>it is okay because if he wants to be no longer a slave and he makes himself see he can give it to everyone<end>
<start>no it is that song<end>
<start>better not think about it<end>
<start>they will not have new nucleus just physical power to every time that goes with getting a shadow eclatfragment<end>
<start>finally ananke had another version<end>
<start>we must have seen his first name in the work<end>
<start>okay tkt it is pg i am just going to go cry in a corner<end>
<start>it cuts<end>
<start>i do not know if they can walk around or if there is anything that pushes them in the rdr<end>
<start>it would seem to me incoherent precq he already had a hole in his fields in this nightmare<end>
<start>yeah fine she could remove the sword after a while<end>
<start>we need to talk<end>
<start>but so that is putting batons in the wheels<end>
<start>he may have met a supreme<end>
<start>i will have a little bit of a whim to listen to each of your voices<end>
<start>when i would make them read<end>
<start>not necessarily if he is no longer the slaves of someone he can become the one of another<end>
<start>like you think<end>
<start>it could actually be very funny<end>
<start>what are they busy with<end>
<start>they are the ones who decide<end>
<start>if you look at the beginning of the volume the memory level is not displayed and sunny says it<end>
<start>my instincts feel the drama coming<end>
<start>forgive me<end>
<start>when<end>
<start>but she knows what can happen to her<end>
<start>moreover rip the rest of the sherry relic of aspect of sunny that he will never get shibalaugh<end>
<start>the post-eme nightmare will be crazy me i say<end>
<start>he still has them<end>
<start>who does not spoil<end>
<start>will read it again<end>
<start>would explain how they got the name of the bird<end>
<start>jle understand how he killed the demon to recover the citadel<end>
<start>at the same time i think it is better for sunny to go later when he is more powerful at the same time i think that the more he waits the more he sees powerful creatures and the more dangerous it will be<end>
<start>so for you the winter beast gets exterminated by the butterfly of the same nightmare<end>
<start>i did not see anything<end>
<start>we talk about it again in chap shibalagh<end>
<start>she must be happy<end>
<start>yeah it is true but we do not know how it works his immortality and his corrupt double of the estuary was defeated because he had no more reflections at his disposal<end>
<start>animepray<end>
<start>pfiou<end>
<start>ariel fought a divine titan to build his pyramid<end>
<start>but on the other hand she is got a bad face<end>
<start>because i do not know if he still exists<end>
<start>ah can be interesting to add antagonists or allies<end>
<start>then areas that killed his parents and halted his purification of the world<end>
<start>i am really wondering what it would be like<end>
<start>they are or the new rules of the spoiler salon<end>
<start>they always trust her<end>
<start>cassie she is so petty shibalaugh<end>
<start>what is the description of the estuary clee<end>
<start>which is just beside the desert or has taken place the war<end>
<start>haste of the introduction dasterion also<end>
<start>from what i understood they want to put it just so it does not appear like a pluc<end>
<start>imagine that the first name of gray his tristan you do what<end>
<start>i think he will be his own master<end>
<start>well it depends on how it is done<end>
<start>what do not you talk about<end>
<start>yeah not wrong it is sure but this side of it really remains a slave and accepts it for me cz changes all the personnality of sunny dcp i am rather adept of your theory and it could be really interesting<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewsssoon-cat-peking-gif-<end>
<start>but nephis is too cute<end>
<start>god but all the time they say it is for what already<end>
<start>of course it is a theory<end>
<start>we had lisekai in the same nightmare<end>
<start>totally because of his connection to weaver<end>
<start>i also agree<end>
<start>how it is called phone calls in ss<end>
<start>here<end>
<start>the seer<end>
<start>she blew herself up xd<end>
<start>thank you batman<end>
<start>but she cannot get memories by killing creatures or even getting them from someone else<end>
<start>wai<end>
<start>but in real life it is crazy that suny finds the weaving of the soul just before breaking her destiny<end>
<start>hi i have a question the epine runny of sunny it received when exactly i do not speak the chapter or it appears for the first time but in the chronology of the shore forgets<end>
<start>attention to what you wish it has already been explained or not<end>
<start>what has been forgotten will be recalled and will consume the world defile corruption<end>
<start>i hope it is true<end>
<start>you think what camp between valor and song will win the war<end>
<start>they were snakes<end>
<start>a pure masterclass<end>
<start>plus he is probably the only saint who can resist morgan's failure<end>
<start>it is not bad<end>
<start>the only thing that has the limit is that it is less lethal to the groove but it is against the principles of sunny<end>
<start>we did not see him bcp but he looks like a goat<end>
<start>blackhole<end>
<start>damn it we were all right<end>
<start>yes the god forgets the god of dreams<end>
<start>well yeah it is sunny that could be different<end>
<start>junior<end>
<start>ss which turns into a novel of cultivation<end>
<start>g said i believe that only these on one a divine aspect<end>
<start>do not ask<end>
<start>bah after<end>
<start>i remembered he was closing his eye to the moon<end>
<start>so a cohort has itself<end>
<start>and therefore potentially cross on the battlefield<end>
<start>that sunny will become a policeman soon<end>
<start>i did not understand what you said but he wants to keep the groove independent<end>
<start>when we get tortured like this<end>
<start>but it is totally crazy that i am telling you not looking mdr<end>
<start>you will prefer to kill our national kai<end>
<start>sunny asterion bite and nephis for valor and song<end>
<start>but by the way i have a doubt<end>
<start>for me it is just temporarily lost<end>
<start>o i see it was the one with the biggest pair<end>
<start>where there is going to be at least<end>
<start>so if he can weave sons of destiny and connect again to others maybe they will at least stop forgetting<end>
<start>or then she will see things in a changing way that would constantly move or things that never happen but that should have happened like that but i think she will find a way in any way with transcendence or something else can be in truth the possibilities are really numerous<end>
<start>so use on a guy without destiny is what his dream a little his old him<end>
<start>now so sighted that sunny is a saint and that are master attribute of shadows to the lord of shadows i think he can control the domain at least make it disappear and make it appear again from the lantern<end>
<start>with the winter beast<end>
<start>i am waiting to see too<end>
<start>nothing says that sunny is the only one to have an affinity with the thin shades of a slurry is to confirm that it is not the only one<end>
<start>not only the end<end>
<start>even sunny not on<end>
<start>so maybe give us some info on mortret but i do not think mortret will tell us the fight<end>
<start>she is not bad at all she just did not care about the happiness of sunny<end>
<start>he is still waiting for the event to be over<end>
<start>is reached<end>
<start>that is why he is so smart and he is been able to adapt to men's customs for infiltrators<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewskelitor-one-day-mad-pissed-gif-<end>
<start>and bitert woke up soon<end>
<start>sunny also shibalaugh<end>
<start>i love<end>
<start>this end of v has made talk but i am going to this is really the best volume of all work<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>i read then i come back but the name of the next flight already<end>
<start>i think there is only neph with him<end>
<start>he gave it up or not<end>
<start>and for the piaf jule puts in the same box that the end depends on what the author will do with<end>
<start>g cliffhangers<end>
<start>i do not even know what he is talking about<end>
<start>so the memory disappears unless it is strange as the crown of dawn or the mask of weaver<end>
<start>we can never have the exact number unless g gives it<end>
<start>in real as with nephis i am not sure that they need to learn to form an excellent duo to a lesser extent and i am talking about sunnymordret post elypse understand them well enough the other so that they can complete themselves<end>
<start>he wrote history g<end>
<start>there is only one<end>
<start>yeah but just to be on it is the same person<end>
<start>the fact that sunny of the future is indicative who will regret getting into it makes me think that it is something that could disturb sunny and i imagine the body of nephis<end>
<start>no cassia cbpray<end>
<start>it is not the one that sunny meets in antarctics<end>
<start>on the other hand kai i see him becoming some kind of eagle or hawk<end>
<start>since it is a demon she killed she is got cores so she is going to get laid<end>
<start>the same true person of history<end>
<start>i am sorry it is mwa i started the war kissed the kids but i keep gray dcp it is my fault if you do not have your pepeevil chaps<end>
<start>destiny and destiny<end>
<start>in summary i am not on dcp<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewvilaine-main-tape-hand-gif-<end>
<start>among you<end>
<start>as if she knew her choice would change her life<end>
<start>break your chains<end>
<start>sunny progresses faster yes<end>
<start>because i think it is that sunny's been successful<end>
<start>we saw sunny go to the estuary<end>
<start>but even he has that his physics finally impure beast<end>
<start>after that i think that the only one that can go there is sunny and so that it can become a shadow and in addition to high level it can sneak in the battle in the desert and infiltrate during the battle to the tomb<end>
<start>worse feeling eveerrrrrrr<end>
<start>no but i agree that it would be inventing just like that<end>
<start>sonc no helmet one shot for most<end>
<start>i am dead he is got the soum to hear the dcp exit he created a memory that rehearses his shibalaugh voice<end>
<start>but it remains rather vague in the sense that only cassia knows the consequences of this destiny and has done everything to prevent it<end>
<start>so it is possible that it is inspired<end>
<start>of work<end>
<start>we will probably see him later<end>
<start>the lines the mask<end>
<start>and as for the line of the cyou are a child is not obliged to have it maybe it is that the groin is seen with sevirax and the prince of the sun<end>
<start>c possible but i do not believe<end>
<start>but on the other hand the positive in all this is that we are not going to see a new cohort with sunny has her head<end>
<start>asterion<end>
<start>jet not nephis possible but little pretente the same circumstance that sunny the they are killed terror<end>
<start>psq he vanquished a third nightmare so he is a ptetra saint<end>
<start>it is possible<end>
<start>qqn can confirm whether jdis nimp or not<end>
<start>with shadows obviously<end>
<start>seeing that i think a lepoch or the sortlege is coming already had to be like masters and saints who even when could be attached to the sortlege<end>
<start>in the end i found it even better<end>
<start>and<end>
<start>shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>thank you<end>
<start>someone may remember sunny<end>
<start>if is a conditional not an affirmation i specify<end>
<start>you think she will get destiny<end>
<start>i started with you and i started with kiffe<end>
<start>a jagged piece of cold black stone resembling the building blocks of the tomb of ariel it had no features runes or images and appeared like a rough palm-sized chunk of stone randomly picked from the ground<end>
<start>if that is the case it is possible that in fact the fact that he wanted to kill hop was for another even greater purpose at least until he was abandoned by his father<end>
<start>what happiness<end>
<start>do not overdo it<end>
<start>limit effie as tjr<end>
<start>just<end>
<start>who knows<end>
<start>good a sovereign who lived hundreds dannees with his transformation and a guy who learned in weeks<end>
<start>ascamtao<end>
<start>you forget something the guys the cassie transfo would tie to the memory and forgets her like her that she had recyou the real name of the thief from torment is what she would not have found a way thanks to her to remember sunny<end>
<start>plat twist of cassia in the tomb or end of the scarlet tower<end>
<start>and obel said not to look at the moon<end>
<start>after they did not have a transcendent sword<end>
<start>i am going to end up tonight laughing<end>
<start>an unclean beast atomizes a dormant titan<end>
<start>the crown<end>
<start>i believe<end>
<start>it says that people could sit down without the exit leg but it just made it easier<end>
<start>so in theory if the domain is just on the no name temple then the domain can move with<end>
<start>ar has no relation at all<end>
<start>while neph took her liberty<end>
<start>he would have created death to cause the god to sink because weaver would have seen destiny<end>
<start>between each volume must wait a long time<end>
<start>stop smoking<end>
<start>i did not understand everything in your sentence<end>
<start>otherwise sunny is completely immune to cssie it must even a little pertubee she can even more anticipate what it technically it<end>
<start>he said after<end>
<start>is what there is also a connection to if the person he is talking to believes him because he thinks that everything that sunny said was mostly lies<end>
<start>because otherwise imp it can be a goat<end>
<start>example the sea of the soul of sunny could be considered as his domain his citadel inside him<end>
<start>i will do my research and see<end>
<start>before he was part of the weapon mtn he is the weapon<end>
<start>i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i mean i<end>
<start>let adults do it<end>
<start>i do not think we have any information on it until a personal moment what would be the relationship between ascension as sovereign and lines<end>
<start>closed discussion<end>
<start>jet it comes from power up<end>
<start>the famous first grain of sand<end>
<start>he will not reach the divine rank in theorie seeing that he does not have a divine aspect<end>
<start>oh c<end>
<start>it is been weeks he is on vacation x<end>
<start>real it is broken because no one can identify it anymore and if for breakie it does not work for others it probably will not work<end>
<start>as effie and jet will probably have the same transfo as their versions defile<end>
<start>yeah really g knows how to turn on us every time<end>
<start>a pleasure<end>
<start>i pray to see whoever tries to send us this in braille<end>
<start>finally back in this living room<end>
<start>he is a titan<end>
<start>it would be too simple and too powerful<end>
<start>i pray to all my cyou are that it will not happen<end>
<start>it is for his that i see him no more asking for a reshaping of the shadow bond by thinking about what was grated on the wood end in fashion he will reflect on how his wish can be realized and will not ask to be free but legal nephis can be<end>
<start>i just got up to date and what crazy<end>
<start>after he may also have understood that doamines are not necessarily physical<end>
<start>yes but from his point of view is what he can say the same sentence with his default and mask<end>
<start>ba for the blow it will be the first normal wake seen which will be the first to do it without the exit leg laughs<end>
<start>so you are going to find your happiness<end>
<start>thank you gray for the taff hat of those tonight<end>
<start>but he talked to weaver after<end>
<start>yes actually for them but sunny has lost the line of shadow replaced by the line prohibited from weaver<end>
<start>that is crazy he can train his boy to manage a girl and prepare a war at the same time<end>
<start>tomorrow i will see you again<end>
<start>it is effective this bono jai even do not need to answer that it explains<end>
<start>i do not understand the people who read just because they want to know what is next<end>
<start>you think sunny's going to get the release<end>
<start>he did what weaver did<end>
<start>chp but may be that as sunny has a more difficult evolution than others has an infinite growth<end>
<start>jpense that sunny will flop to death ptdrrrrrr<end>
<start>she is just making the right decisions based on what she saw<end>
<start>i hope one day he fights body at the same time<end>
<start>i was thinking<end>
<start>bah perso will also prefer that like everyone else but will g do that no idea<end>
<start>look irritated it is deco when i started talking about it<end>
<start>peche du reconfort cest translated no<end>
<start>he the shadow avatar a godgrave<end>
<start>crazy work catscream<end>
<start>oe nan i say nothing eft it is not logical that i tell x<end>
<start>i do not know but i am sure everyone loves him<end>
<start>and again it is going to be difficult<end>
<start>will check the pov cassie<end>
<start>also<end>
<start>but we do not know if he will be able to break it<end>
<start>chut<end>
<start>that would be funny<end>
<start>already asterion is probably by far the most powerful its aspects is bound to the soul and must be of very high rank<end>
<start>you are too beautiful uwu<end>
<start>like ro<end>
<start>this is not the place<end>
<start>oe wholesale<end>
<start>i have got chap again and i am done with it<end>
<start>nobody said the daemons died the only thing we know ajd is they fell<end>
<start>the first is the same it is incredible<end>
<start>towards the middle or the end of the journey in the vortex jsplus says that this super bright so it sticks at this moment i think<end>
<start>i would say the first encounter with the winter beast or sunny talks about the survival of lhumanite after the death of his cohort<end>
<start>psq he likes the number too much and at the end of the flight he said we were half-hearted<end>
<start>if you want to be free you have to give up your humanity something like that<end>
<start>gender changing aspects<end>
<start>explosive cocktail<end>
<start>what kind of madness even<end>
<start>tell you i have been spoiled by some noting logs<end>
<start>makes her think of the good old times as she says<end>
<start>and now ya larc trading undercover wedding arrange<end>
<start>the chaps have me<end>
<start>or he is still alive somewhere quietly playing with the destiny shibalaugh<end>
<start>i just read what you were going to say i am on my ass<end>
<start>saying otherwise would be lying<end>
<start>asterion he makes his life of his own<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>you are usually threatened before starting a non-procedure<end>
<start>courage<end>
<start>and in a certain sense it is quite predictable<end>
<start>sunny and groin is a long story of hatred and brotherly love<end>
<start>you have to be a fp to throw a guy who treats us by translating a work and free of charge into<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewstar-trek-star-trek-tos-spock-cleaning-organizing-gif-<end>
<start>and at worst i think that effie can be content with only a half<end>
<start>this is the best time of work to make a big break<end>
<start>then<end>
<start>and i who was wondering who was the saint that sunny had made appear i hope not to be the only one who had forgotten it<end>
<start>he has not been enough yet<end>
<start>i would have to get back to the day<end>
<start>or even if there is not a connection with her<end>
<start>o it is sure but there is probably pepita<end>
<start>but it is true it is going well<end>
<start>and then it is already a bit started with nephis that verifies that sunny is an effective coequipier against the skin walker<end>
<start>in<end>
<start>if you see the message does not go up on top spoil<end>
<start>ohhh there are times when we risk seeing you pop seeing the scenes x<end>
<start>you are very hot<end>
<start>at any time sunny dies and we end up with just groove as the main person shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>chicken<end>
<start>he does not really have a test<end>
<start>not his volume prefers because there is everything i would like to have in volumes of ss a little action of the romance of the gold and the different povs on the perso for me all his fact that my volume prefers<end>
<start>so i probably made a mistake about the theory mdr<end>
<start>i want another dose<end>
<start>but for him to have a nightmare together must be very close what<end>
<start>even i struggle i have to read a little more<end>
<start>i do not want to imagine that shibalaugh<end>
<start>kai is always as scary a cry and timplose<end>
<start>i am thinking about it<end>
<start>on the other hand jespere that all the next chapter will not just be all the people who come in through his store<end>
<start>i have never been so lost mdrr<end>
<start>it allows to go faster<end>
<start>the other possessors had it after their nightmare<end>
<start>i confess certain person we in defense dog and she has sunny<end>
<start>vsy good night i go night white and think what asterion jerks on the moon<end>
<start>the dream life he is right<end>
<start>he says for example that neph has the line of the sun but that his appearance seems more connected to the nephilim than mordert to the line of war but that his appearance is potentially linked to nothing<end>
<start>he is sovereign of no clan<end>
<start>it has flow a rye wsh<end>
<start>you are right<end>
<start>okay that is what i thought<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthe-rock-wrestlemania--throat-wrestlemania-xl-wwe-gif-<end>
<start>we have to talk about the sovereigns when<end>
<start>he even says it to him<end>
<start>yes<end>
<start>i think it is not really cassie but rather weaver by influencing cassie which is the origin<end>
<start>and must admit that it is a kiffant<end>
<start>but it is true that for fallen creatures it is suspicious<end>
<start>psq in the tomb is a beast<end>
<start>yeah i am right under there<end>
<start>or pay attention to the wish<end>
<start>but we heard from the desert conquete<end>
<start>and i am going to teach you something if one day crest of soul is serialized elsewhere than on royal road genre at an editor i hope for you that you will have a written agreement with the author for trade<end>
<start>the attribute that sunny had at the very beginning it was destiny so it would mean that he already had a connection with weaver without necessarily having the forbidden line so maybe rain will be able to have an attribute related to weaver or why not to another deamon and grab the forbidden line by eating a bit of weaver as sunny<end>
<start>yeah from time to time alone but he does the next day<end>
<start>sunny chap<end>
<start>kai the best<end>
<start>cimmer for chaps<end>
<start>nop gray is not for<end>
<start>pufeelsstrongman<end>
<start>name in mode names have a sunless influence no sun shadow<end>
<start>that is boring i like this channel i will not jlect in english<end>
<start>and i think even though he was a perso<end>
<start>explain to me<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>yeah i got it<end>
<start>i do not think he wanted her to buy them<end>
<start>then we talk about a duo nephis and sunny<end>
<start>i cannot believe it but it is not impossible<end>
<start>it is going to be a world that is going to be all rotten<end>
<start>ahh x at the base i thought it was coreen<end>
<start>but i do not see him banging a titan superior bridge so much you do not forget the power of this shit<end>
<start>ah they are really fast it is chapter but they are good<end>
<start>his ability i still do not get back<end>

<start>he needs a fan club<end>
<start>know that it is really difficult to refrain from reading slavic shadow<end>
<start>it is not a reproduction it is the same because the crown of daeron was somehow the key to the system of defense of dusk<end>
<start>for now that is the only reason i am in the mood<end>
<start>must be almost a year<end>
<start>but there is something even worse when you read every day<end>
<start>titan superieur is already not so bad shibalaugh<end>
<start>it is not the dariel coffin<end>
<start>it is serious damage though<end>
<start>but i think it is someone who threw me away<end>
<start>but they do not remember mongrel or the lantarctic devil as nan<end>
<start>everyone died in this case--<end>
<start>you compare chaps to x and then it is not the parlor for lotm we are going to get hit on x<end>
<start>she comes back to see sunny and the boom<end>
<start>in real life a sunny solo would make serious pleasure with its monologues<end>
<start>but the saint will want to recruit him<end>
<start>i cannot sleep on that feeling and that feeling mdrrr<end>
<start>i do not like what you say<end>
<start>but if he has to lose one it is holy in real life<end>
<start>hahaha reel<end>

<start>do not believe the other saints they are weak horn sinister bat sunny without memories<end>
<start>impressive chaps<end>
<start>i did not even think about it<end>
<start>it will not surprise me that different person is a water authority<end>
<start>and that would be why he disappeared<end>
<start>i gave everything<end>
<start>a terror<end>
<start>not sure he has the level for solo yet<end>
<start>yeah i know that<end>
<start>i confess i forgot<end>
<start>i made him read to another guy<end>
<start>we saw drop one contained the weaving of the blood fragment of the weaver line the other contained the line of the shadow<end>
<start>oh bah i recommend you the catalog of world novel especially tbate in big priority<end>
<start>at any time she wishes her good birthday for years because of a coincidence<end>
<start>the hype level i got around this guy<end>
<start>it is so funny<end>
<start>you get caught by the collar every time you come here<end>
<start>he gets me out of these theories sunny<end>
<start>unfortunately but imagine he happens to put this enchantment on the memory of binding that he will create<end>
<start>you are right he is been here at least year<end>
<start>unlikely i think<end>
<start>it is true what told him that everyone would probably forget it never if he went there shibalaugh<end>
<start>yeah but he would have to completely change his appearance for that and we do not know how it is going to turn out yet<end>
<start>i think she knows that sunny was running already nephis before forgotten<end>

<start>kindle<end>
<start>i think it is my top or in terms of volume<end>
<start>i did not have time to read them yesterday<end>
<start>especially that in my memory as sunny she can see the attributes of people but if it happens i just remember the more she can also see the class and all she knows may be that it is a saint if she forgets it but in the cases the next chapter may be a banger<end>
<start>while even for saints it is not easy to fight against superior creatures<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewdrama-cute-oh-my-life-gif-<end>
<start>i did not see it like that<end>
<start>on such jsp<end>
<start>if you cannot understand it is okay<end>
<start>i am in a hurry to see kai<end>
<start>in fact the best would be that the shadow link is changed but not removed and there is no death<end>
<start>because his shadows are bound to his soul and his nuclei<end>

<start>comprehensible mdr already a day it must be a taf sacre<end>
<start>that is how it ends when you give a fool the right to write<end>
<start>we will see the beginning of the small ellipse conquete of a few months then we will resume just before the scouts of the two clans cross and then clash between the two a little year maybe<end>
<start>i am hype anyway the g he goes on something i think i will like it<end>
<start>and dcp the shore forgets<end>
<start>and the evolution of the shadows especially of saint who became bcp slower with each shadow that has its method<end>
<start>i do not even think there is going to be any nightmares i think it is going to evolve differently<end>
<start>i know i have read the story but do weaver have them because it was at his brothers' house or because he knew that sunny would go through the later<end>
<start>the skin walker i am scence know him<end>
<start>it is all right<end>
<start>then he is in a bundle to fight<end>

<start>you see vrm bite at someone is command<end>
<start>i doubt it but i do not rule out your theory<end>
<start>for now it is more defence axis<end>
<start>or something like that<end>
<start>strange all this<end>
<start>maybe not<end>
<start>i will go see what they say on the wiki<end>
<start>if she absolutely wanted that gun rather than the good of sunny she would just close her mouth and wash to the blow job<end>
<start>yeah he is probably going to weave his own version of the release but it is going to be loonnnng<end>
<start>nop snake is bound to the advance of heritage<end>
<start>one day maybe<end>
<start>rubber<end>
<start>and after the murder he regretted his act and undertook to have a cycle or nobody is corrupted and nephis remains alive<end>
<start>wow g takes risks doing this can be very interesting if it exploits it well<end>
<start>so she is sure she knows the decision of sunny nan<end>
<start>there is no one in the same rank<end>
<start>it is not the underground world already<end>
<start>the whole epub<end>
<start>yes for him because good if sunny would have made a malaise or destroyed the theater during the piece it would not have been ouf for the image of their relationship shibalaugh<end>

<start>you just have to create a domain that may in some cases require a real name<end>

<start>it is effie shibalaugh<end>
<start>moreover with his weaving of the soul he probably has the most powerful soul among all the saints not<end>
<start>you are talking about his destiny attribute<end>
<start>that is a whole different subject and now the rules are clear for everyone i think<end>
<start>i said shit ptdrrrr<end>
<start>you did not say no chaps tonight<end>
<start>she is going to snitch on the snag<end>
<start>cassia prophecies are very precise oe<end>
<start>so force to the bird i think that sunny who returns to the tomb is to declare it<end>
<start>a great word to protect<end>
<start>other than defending his soul<end>
<start>so i really think there will be a paradox in the tomb<end>
<start>imagine weaver manipulating cassie by sending him clearly deceptive visions<end>
<start>well if it says in the chap<end>
<start>it is like the fragment of the shadow domain<end>
<start>i take the risk<end>
<start>and no one can attack them in any other way<end>

<start>it will hurt me but see him in a nightmare in zeus mode extending in a pool with plenty of random around him why not<end>
<start>effie will stay alive<end>
<start>in real life we will all know why the boat is one of the only secrets that remains for the moment in the nightmare<end>
<start>ben from parent to child this is the principle of a line what shibalaugh<end>
<start>yeah it is true<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewokay-ok-ok-ok-oh-ok-oh-okay-gif-<end>
<start>that having met him to the lover of love because he was already on it at the time when they went up<end>
<start>batman's coming back<end>
<start>i agree<end>
<start>yes but much less than before when you look at the first chapters he really just wants to look at everyone suffering he has no notion of good and evil no trust in humans and no affinity with humans either<end>
<start>but sunny with a little preparation is inconvenient<end>
<start>i like chaps too much right now<end>
<start>especially in view of the galeries which they have lived in the interior i see not going back there without being a minimum serene<end>
<start>i stay on the theory of the lie domain between sunny and nephis<end>
<start>plus they do not have too much time<end>
<start>like thanyt said<end>
<start>instead of asking to make you spoil share your theories with us you may come across clues that we did not get you reading chaps we read a long time ago so you are more able to talk about it than we are<end>
<start>i did not know there was a chalk and like a guignol i went to talk to them<end>
<start>technically she could advance until master without too much difficulty because you just have to have a perfect control of her essence and body<end>
<start>ohh cankerlove<end>
<start>sunny with info he is invincible<end>
<start>it is asterion that used its powers to transform shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>we can theorize we have the tps<end>
<start>ok i just wanted to help when i wrote in site note<end>
<start>it is actually possible<end>
<start>just times at the place of chap he stationed or<end>
<start>do not feel<end>
<start>it is not suare a we have no official information but the line is probably the thing that is transmitted and that allows people to have aspects close to neph to the attribute fire that says it belongs to the line of the sun god but it is his great father who must have got it when he did not have the divine aspect<end>
<start>i see it last years but i do not see a volume of - chap adapt years<end>
<start>it stings ahah<end>
<start>so it is the same for tbate<end>
<start>haaa<end>
<start>yeah to hide these feelings towards me were the mentally ill<end>
<start>pants<end>
<start>it is just that g post his chapters mega late right now so i post before him and it happens that he posts chapter and i am not guessing yet so i do as i see fit<end>
<start>it is okay the problem is rule<end>
<start>not even<end>
<start>titan dechu plutot<end>
<start>okay that is right<end>
<start>tears flowed<end>
<start>nan mm not on the theory of fighting shibalaugh<end>
<start>i do not think he can take destiny away<end>
<start>a domain of the size of the moon brothel<end>
<start>can it be considered bipolarite<end>
<start>i also personal it is chill to read as long as it is not like that it is cool it develops the atmosphere of the worldlore persos etc<end>
<start>ah rain but rain<end>
<start>i am not sure it will be lost from light<end>
<start>what to do<end>
<start>att but he is got access to his transfo without going out<end>
<start>thank you for this chapter<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>same base<end>
<start>almost yes but not so strong<end>
<start>anyway jen had seen theories jen had done too but he even managed to take us short and surprise us with something sick<end>
<start>because he bit was found a citadel nan<end>
<start>there is not necessarily class it is maybe just at this moment that nephis unlocks the ability to make glare shadows<end>
<start>looks like a banger<end>
<start>not its speculation from sunny there is not yet proof its really is the kingdom of war<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewhyper-cucumberrr-dancing-cucumber-gif-<end>
<start>more connected to nothing<end>
<start>it is not about obel hypothesis<end>
<start>in my memories it was long crazy<end>
<start>kai did not act when they said he sacrificed himself for neph because it was the truth at that time for the world<end>
<start>i must have forgotten a line because i thought it was crazy that if the wish of qq was in no way related to destiny or what it could even realize<end>
<start>but his power comforts me in the idea that he is going to ride alone<end>
<start>i was super hype by this end<end>
<start>flemme to wait a few more chapters to discover the groove capabilities<end>
<start>yes i thought they were stocked other by but since there is lantern it is not possible<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewfragile-handle-with-care-box-gif-<end>
<start>i even think they think they can make it a leash for nephis shibalaugh<end>
<start>especially since the first researcher is therefore not strategic<end>
<start>otherwise asterion would have already done something<end>
<start>bha if sunny says he is a mongrel without the mask is that it is a truth and if he says he is a mongrel avcec mask it is also a lie no<end>
<start>the child soldier would pass average<end>

<start>the real masterclass too<end>
<start>nan really was something this arc not to mention all the revelations on the lore of ss<end>
<start>i really agree with that<end>
<start>at least mtn we will see what is connected to the release and what is not<end>

<start>it is for dog designer<end>
<start>the sovereigns<end>

<start>in literal translation yes but it brings more poesie and you understand that the concept is complex and must be reflected<end>
<start>thank you comrade<end>
<start>but they are off screen<end>
<start>it is not just a legend<end>
<start>i dropped the mask<end>
<start>i think it has something to do with it<end>
<start>that is better<end>
<start>i am so hype<end>
<start>by the way are we sure there are rank nightmares<end>
<start>or the fact that he could present himself with a groove like his brother since he had not washed before<end>
<start>yes we see it with the flame of desire of creation<end>
<start>it is more<end>
<start>the formulation suggests that it has an authority but the word authority is not written<end>
<start>there is a chance we will have a dead man<end>
<start>i am not propaganda<end>
<start>or even talk about it<end>
<start>it is a parpaing<end>
<start>the only thing that damaged the dananke ketch is the temporal temple and dcp for me claws them from the mad prince<end>
<start>she offered her the way to succeed her project<end>
<start>and biter who later becomes sovereign it is on he cannot stay behind compared to sunny and nephis<end>
<start>if they have to create supply corridors secure and advance their group they will take some time when even given the danger of the corner after the first at all times there is bitert who shows up to harass the valor camp<end>
<start>maybe a guy from the same year as us but we were like my memories are blurred<end>
<start>you know it is a mockery of sunny telling him he was not stupid enough to take his fault with him<end>
<start>he can be a couple miles away guys<end>
<start>yeah but if that is the case then that is it<end>
<start>but then the gods are in the belly of their creations<end>
<start>mdr c reel ca<end>
<start>do not confuse it with the big and beautiful naeve<end>
<start>i hope there is no love between cassie and sunny's interest and we do not fall into the shit harem<end>
<start>but it was still my favorite<end>
<start>that sunny goes back to do dirty this old papi<end>
<start>what is her fault already<end>
<start>they just have the common benefits of leveil like gas etc<end>
<start>everything's going well<end>
<start>sour<end>
<start>jcrois would ask the author to change<end>
<start>so read and you will see<end>
<start>well i am too excited to taste the sunny pancakes<end>
<start>tyx for gray chaps<end>
<start>wait till the day<end>
<start>actual<end>
<start>he succeeded in ensuring that half of the work fell tome<end>
<start>and seeing that he and neph would not surprise me that they were sacred especially to beat the piaf and not sovereign<end>
<start>they also have pieces of mirror with them<end>
<start>and a house also mdr<end>
<start>the fight against harus i have had so much<end>
<start>after that says that without the wounds it is not so scary that it the first researcher<end>
<start>our savior<end>
<start>i did not think it was related to astrion but i thought there was something important to the moon story<end>
<start>his nightmare was not irrational it is the way he finished it that the sortlege considered exceptional<end>
<start>and for me jet is more bound to death than to the souls<end>
<start>o but that is not the point<end>
<start>the saint of the clan also thinks<end>
<start>so he already has his community dedicated to him<end>
<start>he is naked<end>
<start>that would be merite shibalaugh<end>
<start>if we are going to be biting about not forgetting but good<end>
<start>no sunny will find a discount<end>
<start>those of ajd<end>
<start>me too<end>
<start>yep<end>
<start>i read the chaps in days<end>
<start>okay thanks i am going to go to another living room before i get spoiled<end>
<start>teams cockroaches with mordret<end>
<start>the poor she stopped interrupting her questions telllzmt she can more<end>
<start>i will have to tell them one day<end>
<start>ah though<end>
<start>but that it is wished the wrong thing<end>
<start>tkt his steps your fault his the risk he runs to come talk about it on the spoil chanel<end>
<start>it is not said but it will not surprise me that she is done the same by herself<end>
<start>even if nobody remembers it<end>
<start>the relationship between neph and sunny has the beach frankly i surkiff<end>
<start>it is highly probable<end>
<start>that is what i thought too<end>
<start>also possible<end>
<start>i am really sorry to have this nightmare<end>
<start>that is not to say whisper<end>
<start>there is too much to do with him to make it happen<end>
<start>basically it is her<end>
<start>almost the obal-maske professor<end>
<start>possible<end>
<start>and a sport academie bow<end>
<start>just a wish and everything is regulated without against a soft part<end>
<start>nephis jumping from ivory lily in pajamas to go save sunny shibalaugh shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>and that would be why the mother of neph became hollow by being a master kills by asterion<end>
<start>but i doubt it<end>
<start>rest his first vacation after days in a row<end>
<start>and we do not know yet<end>
<start>that is what i was going to say<end>
<start>they have more brotherly relationship<end>
<start>cassie is really an amazing person<end>
<start>or weaver<end>
<start>you are fucking screwed<end>
<start>but if sunny goes into the mtn pyramid he is not going to cross the nightmare sunny<end>
<start>having regard to the title of the volume<end>
<start>not like their parents shibalaugh<end>
<start>even though i do not think it is giving that now he is focused attention on the fate of sunny and not on the final fight<end>
<start>yes fleau<end>
<start>you lunatic will<end>
<start>ha so the aspect is optional<end>
<start>so it is just a person who is rank-in-law that is it<end>
<start>so i have a careful question spoil i am chapter and made or see sunny and everything with all his shadows that do a different thing but he still has not fought with two shadows every time the author wants the nerve xd<end>
<start>just one mistake i think<end>
<start>okay but like sunny major of tears just dispawned like this<end>
<start>but she says it i do not remember<end>
<start>i do not think so<end>
<start>even if some are not up to date it is at their risk and beads<end>
<start>i do not see the future<end>
<start>i thought mostly of the author's pov<end>
<start>he is not going to tell everything<end>
<start>rather modify it<end>
<start>she has to remember saintly since she continues to want to become a wake it would be because she did not associate saintly with sunny nephis she did not recognize saintly otherwise than as one of the statues of her nightmare she would have forgotten it as she knows she belongs to a sunny<end>
<start>he is going to wish he had a new epee mdr<end>
<start>that is right<end>
<start>there are people who like to do theories about stuff they read to pretend to be smart<end>
<start>or otherwise<end>
<start>he says he killed the creature in are in but we do not know if it is the citadel or not<end>
<start>okay bv then<end>
<start>okay i did not know i was going to do it<end>
<start>the people are already afraid of rain while she is not even waking up laughs<end>
<start>it is more the score than the dcp it finds the whole cohort and gradually we suspect that cassie will succeed in demelting the stuff at the level of destiny we saw it well already she already knows that he was with them etc just not the memory but she is sure so little by little i think she will increase the question so more is what at the end it ends losing or it happens by the magic of destiny ah nan works more it to find everything in a similar state a before seeing better<end>
<start>oh fuck the name of the volume but what is going on in ss right now<end>
<start>mdrrrr nan really hurt me too much i have to change my ideas<end>
<start>thank you emiliahappy<end>
<start>g supremacy<end>
<start>i believe there was some stuff after<end>
<start>whenever it mentions it i imagine with his stupid tops on the furry i am at the end<end>
<start>it is a fucking nightmare the tomb<end>
<start>when they said weaver was gone and it was already too late when he came back<end>
<start>as nephis in the sense a feeling he makes others feel<end>
<start>even if he asks<end>
<start>the chapter was resting<end>
<start>my own path is probably chosen by cassy<end>
<start>dodo reading the daily do not on reve<end>
<start>would the seal not have ceder during the war and they seal themselves<end>
<start>bah the kingdom of dreams is their 'link' in itself they are all bound through it only that before the appearance of the sortlege on earth no one was aware but their connection necessarily goes back to the history of the kingdom of dreams and if weaver is actually the sortlege in itself then it repaints it with its will via this link they are already binding the worlds so that weaver can touch them via this link is very probable for me<end>
<start>he cannot get into his soul i forgot<end>
<start>in english<end>
<start>but i am not sure<end>
<start>i did not remember a curse<end>
<start>but he can say his name is mongrel when he has the mask<end>
<start>and if their fault was not impacting the fight it would have been useless<end>
<start>i like too much<end>
<start>fc cassie but it is true that it is a gaillard sacre the brother kai<end>
<start>normally it detects if the guy is lying not if what he says is true<end>
<start>- years you often make mistakes<end>
<start>but the change of pov will do when neph understands what<end>
<start>he remembers it but either think he is dead or do not remember who he is like the daemon of the forgotten<end>
<start>nope at all the god of dreams masters a 'domain' which is a concept a bit like asterion without doubt at a much higher level by separating itself it would have given birth to the daemons each inheriting a concept which he himself mastered<end>
<start>for that i say in battle died<end>
<start>i do not know how you are going to get back to their relationship again considering how the cohort is soda mtn<end>
<start>not false<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewje-sais-pas-i-do not-know-faire-la-grimace-joe-friends-gif-<end>
<start>and it is still there so it is okay<end>
<start>i read the webtoon maybe i will continue after<end>
<start>hmm<end>
<start>so i did not see what it was but i wanted to<end>
<start>i mean really bad<end>
<start>for me i am going to do the mess but it would have the perfect volume if jet was dead at the end<end>
<start>and daemons would be beasts<end>
<start>she is tied to her soul directly<end>
<start>but with the return of the mad prince<end>
<start>knowing he did not kill monsters etc in the desert<end>
<start>actually i am not sure i understand why she said it is part of feeding her personal show obviously shibalaugh<end>
<start>it is me it is me<end>
<start>oe c possible as neph with hop<end>
<start>but then sunny even with his mini-sortilege he cannot even trust nightmares<end>
<start>a fight against sunny comes back to being blown up by saints at once<end>
<start>but so much is how he is strong for it<end>
<start>just she does not remember exactly what was happening in your life years ago<end>
<start>well if he was h la<end>
<start>you have an opinion of mine and here it is<end>
<start>the second shibalaugh<end>
<start>the only one almost though i saw barely half the time and stopped for a while<end>
<start>jpp too much information<end>
<start>after mortet controls the house of the night he would probably have accepted morgan's marriage proposal to be able to pee some valor saint and weaken see infiltrate valor in any case mortret would have made a plan in this style for me<end>
<start>it is a theory i have been saying for a long time that every aspect is bound to a superior<end>
<start>that is all that mattered in cassia<end>
<start>yup ca<end>
<start>it comes back to the same<end>
<start>sovereign<end>
<start>i do not know if he has a memory of sunny armor<end>
<start>who will come to change his destiny and die before the others<end>
<start>bah nn its attribute makes spawn a armor<end>
<start>or high-ranking superior<end>
<start>oe elfie what goat<end>
<start>which<end>
<start>yeah but end of work nephis that recovers the tree as a sunny grave and his family euuh<end>
<start>sinister blade or something like jcrois<end>
<start>his would destroy me shibalaugh<end>
<start>more<end>
<start>he is got the heartline of the mind so maybe he is got pawns a bit like a breakie<end>
<start>and ariel that has revealed it in my memories<end>
<start>bah oe for the logik coup<end>
<start>chapter in any case<end>
<start>no he has no reason to be the only one to see them he has nothing for<end>
<start>the discussed sunnycass they are tjrs well<end>
<start>but i am asking if sunny's going to go on alone or if he is going to find the cohort or even join a clan<end>
<start>superior i am on his class that i doubted<end>
<start>they do not even have the effects<end>
<start>and you are here to rale for romance chapters on<end>
<start>there is a chance he is going to finish there by the end of the shibalaugh volume<end>
<start>as long as you do not ping someone willingly etc to tell them obviously do not abuse but as long as it is the gray trade you are safe<end>
<start>peepocrywhy<end>
<start>me taking an impossible vacation<end>
<start>he is done some tests for me that is what is been paying him the most<end>
<start>more t wait less tauras of motivation<end>
<start>biting with time it has a potential of just infinite growth it create reflections that become more and more powerful etc at the end it would make it a real weapon<end>
<start>be the fruit he ate is weaver the weaving of blood is weaver the phalange we do not know<end>
<start>if it can be we just have to find the piaf<end>
<start>he has the weaver who eats the line of the shadow god<end>
<start>he is enjoying himself<end>
<start>what the fuck is charismatic<end>
<start>for now i am slightly agreed that the quality of the end depends on the sleepy treatment of sunny in the volume<end>
<start>but a max<end>
<start>maree celeste<end>
<start>they would be so damned<end>
<start>and he left completely by passing sovereign<end>
<start>noctis is an ultra-appreciated person<end>
<start>plus i am dsl he has the best introduction of the series<end>
<start>think about what weaver planned for the rest of your life<end>
<start>bahahah<end>
<start>and it is not over<end>
<start>the sorow clan makes me think a little bit of the white feather clan<end>
<start>not possible<end>
<start>oa<end>
<start>you do not talk often here then nan<end>
<start>always she spawn from nowhere to add pepper in the chaps<end>
<start>he would not have done it without her and if cassie would have been in go mode y tkt it would be cool he would have trusted<end>
<start>at some point i think we were talking about a fight between ariel and an unclean titan<end>
<start>there is definitely an explanation<end>
<start>after i think that when you look at the saints<end>
<start>but not sunny who regrets having been at the estuary laughs maybe that if cassie had not washed to go he would have been happier shibalaugh nan but in truth she could at least have prevented him from the consequences that it would have<end>
<start>it is going to be crazy how it is going to sound from everywhere<end>
<start>that is psq she is into what happened to sunny what wants to fight against destiny<end>
<start>on the other hand they all have access to the same so the mm memories the mm essence of name the mm memories<end>
<start>nobody asked you to do reviews will read please<end>
<start>the change of atmosphere between the<end>
<start>even the sunny was really too loud<end>
<start>i felt he was trying to create a sort of ultimate weapon<end>
<start>he really set us the classic scenario of a love webtoon<end>
<start>while kai and effie have fairly similar aspects in their way of using booster and or debuffer so their domain could not in my opinion coexist<end>
<start>and find the delights that will best go to nephis<end>
<start>note when the job is done<end>
<start>i laughed<end>
<start>jprefer believe the author and the future version of the person written by the author that you<end>
<start>mhmm dacc waits to finish<end>
<start>years and a half max<end>
<start>unlike asterion that would be much stronger<end>
<start>wakes out out of the way<end>
<start>think of resolve certain shaded areas<end>
<start>bah take everything if he is a thief nan<end>
<start>like it is random but the real chance that he is going to be known again as mongrel i do not believe it<end>
<start>too hype for the nephis suite<end>
<start>o i think<end>
<start>i am leaving this place and it is dangerous<end>
<start>yen<end>
<start>he cannot have an echo because he is not tied to the exit leg anymore i think<end>
<start>you meant nightmare nan<end>
<start>in real life it may not be likely but it is still possible<end>
<start>i think he is too much<end>
<start>seeing kai<end>
<start>one day like another for our national dark sasuke<end>
<start>yess i let you defend my hutaosalute cassia<end>
<start>we do not know if sunny controls the citadel like a sovereign does<end>
<start>problem my friends do not like to read<end>
<start>he was a ban because of his corruption we do not know if he had time<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewcouple-jacuzzi-dive-gif-<end>
<start>yes they normally do not have access to the memory level in the name of the enchantment and their description<end>
<start>you are not a catscreen yet<end>
<start>the poor in the rdr there is not television yet she has fun as she can<end>
<start>after to return to domain theft if ever the death of a sovereign does not lead to the recovery of his domain then a huge part of the humanite will enter their first nightmare with the death of one of them and that is what each of the two sovereigns wishes to kill the other<end>
<start>it is quiet and there is humor and then suddenly we have a fight against a cursed tyrant<end>
<start>thank you bg<end>
<start>he should reread the work that would help him<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwongwingchun-gif-<end>
<start>gray i love you<end>
<start>vsy good luck finding the extract i am going to sleep<end>
<start>jsp i have the impression that transfos are previewed from the beginning when you chop your look seeing how the sunny shadows already had personalites etc<end>
<start>or else it is the enom<end>
<start>like what cassie talks to sunny while he fights with neph or what it is before or after<end>
<start>psq cassie in the tomb say well what sunny wants to be his weapon against destiny<end>
<start>but vsy all my theories never work catscreen<end>
<start>it is a crazy thing all she says she really has no gene<end>
<start>maybe at last the long-awaited creek<end>
<start>they took the place of their real bodies that is why they appeared so much in the future<end>
<start>the personal horror i cut off the notary<end>
<start>you can explain<end>
<start>bah basically the great river it makes like a donut<end>
<start>she interacts well with sunny that is why<end>
<start>and you got oh but that is actually why<end>
<start>mmhhh interested in your theories<end>
<start>someone is sending the g chanel can be who am's going to answer<end>
<start>naaaaan<end>
<start>yeah but i think it is too personal<end>
<start>nan it is a groove talking<end>
<start>before the lord of shadows<end>
<start>yeah but it is too good<end>
<start>to see him get fucked<end>
<start>but i do not think it influences her like a shadow for example<end>
<start>he asks me he a person i am sure he would like me to give him the name tkt<end>
<start>the two gogoles smokes me with laughter<end>
<start>she just knows he is the anomaly<end>
<start>but it does not mean anything<end>
<start>it was useless to push more on a pov sunny<end>
<start>not the favorite but the most badass i find when he does a job to the guys in the dreamscape tournament<end>
<start>i am sorry it is just that<end>
<start>but now she can no longer since the end of the same nightmare<end>
<start>he can technically but without his real name as anchor the risk of getting lost is so great<end>
<start>veridic<end>
<start>i forgot the weird ritual he did<end>
<start>but it is stupid<end>
<start>that is exactly what i was looking for thanks bcp<end>
<start>effie her nen never ends<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwait-what-meme-wait-a-minute-gif-<end>
<start>with all its shadows if why not the it is well equipped in addition with snake that can take the form of any it creates of its rank that sunny has killed it can do a lot of strategy as we saw it with the bete of winter<end>
<start>arc common life with neph ohv<end>
<start>seeing that his nightmare even waking up to it lasted super long<end>
<start>ha yeah<end>
<start>it happens too<end>
<start>i think that is why i said bebe<end>
<start>the problem is that he does not have the domain of daeron himself that he says is that the water authority will work a bit like a capacity of aspect and that he could make a synergies with his other capa even if i do not see how<end>
<start>i do not understand anything basic and suddenly it talks korean<end>
<start>i confess<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewthe-rock-just-bring-it-let us-go-wwe-raw-gif-<end>
<start>then why the spindle is displayed before the endless spring<end>
<start>but you have got or you have got a tomb<end>
<start>before she knew the date of death of her parents and perhaps members of the cohort jsp<end>
<start>sahhh the chap what monkeyry<end>
<start>in real life you think that sunny's dom will be what<end>
<start>well i hope otherwise he is naked<end>
<start>above i do not know<end>
<start>with sweet words like your friend will betray you again you cannot be loved<end>
<start>when i say kill i am not just talking about winning a fight but just who is really able to end it<end>
<start>but probably with certain condition<end>
<start>that is what it says<end>
<start>sunny giga chad really<end>
<start>and so i think that when they come out of the nightmare a few years will come<end>
<start>and the aspects it has already had to improve also dcp<end>
<start>i did not know it was a vacuum creation<end>
<start>because even if there is still a little lucid we have never seen a monster corrupted by the exitleges using memories<end>
<start>really i am too hype by the game after nightmare<end>
<start>he did not say he did not create much memory for him<end>
<start>dsl to tell you his but gray is the property of the high ruler<end>
<start>i am not sure i can say that much<end>
<start>for me it is just part of weaver's plan<end>
<start>difficult to be crazier than sunny also mdrrrr<end>
<start>it remains more globally of the slice of lice than large chapters<end>
<start>dumpling<end>
<start>yeah when she wants<end>
<start>or she will end up crazy by herself<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewmaybe-not-i-do not-know-maybe-we-do not-know-gif-<end>
<start>not at this point either but he was clearly more bitter and blase than now<end>
<start>she did not want to go too<end>
<start>i already tighten catscream<end>
<start>i think even the sovereigns would leave him alone<end>
<start>you are telling me he does not have the shadow line anymore but he is still using shadows so that is why i do not understand<end>
<start>maybe a charm a bit like that of caster<end>
<start>salvation someone has the chap or the shadow god makes a speech i think it was in the second nightmare<end>
<start>i confess i almost yelled at the matt about the good birthday<end>
<start>at least the sovereigns no doubt<end>
<start>have to press the paragraph to read it<end>
<start>mercee guys<end>
<start>crazy<end>
<start>and with your appearance comes your fault<end>
<start>if the memory is up its weaving is more powerful so more stable not<end>
<start>and after becoming supreme<end>
<start>ananke had said that one must find his fault to become ascendant without the help of the sortlege<end>
<start>you tell me when you are there x<end>
<start>and which is at song<end>
<start>it is russian x<end>
<start>he does not give up important news on the front floor either and he can still change his mind as long as the news is not on the new level<end>
<start>you are finally up to date<end>
<start>agreement<end>
<start>a buffoon sac who just likes to piss off people who produce qql something that pleases a lot<end>
<start>but precisely it is a memory of the external force in addition the runes clearly say that the crown gives the domain of the user an authority on the water not an entire domain necessarily he can use it thoroughly only as sovereign<end>
<start>the same thing when she is here you shut her mouth and listen to her<end>
<start>a very good impression yeah shibalaugh<end>
<start>they will come back before morgan<end>
<start>mdr i have been watching tiktok sec jme am already done spoil i am making install my thing i think<end>
<start>end<end>
<start>it does not work<end>
<start>well i prefer to believe cassie even if you will excuse me<end>
<start>but the god forgets will come back or will have an important role in history<end>
<start>sleepers do not have access to their sea of love that is why they could not see the information<end>
<start>but in real life apart from the nightmares the exitlege has only advantages<end>
<start>i have to read a book for my completion exam en fr<end>
<start>it would be interesting to see sunny soon fall face to face with cursed monsters just see the approximate extent of their powers<end>
<start>can you explain to me how the world of nightmares first nightmares second thirdeect works because i do not understand how it works the i am when it falls and meets the prince of nothing<end>
<start>after sunny is over years old<end>
<start>i kiff the fact that the transformation of kai into holy his a dragon many will be decyou but i find that his really good brings he kills a dragon to become<end>
<start>wake up in the middle of a storm never seen in this groin region that grabs a sword and shoots a tyrant<end>
<start>he likes too much<end>
<start>because he fought superior monsters and a swarm of thousands of corrupted creatures before<end>
<start>like freeing yourself from nephis okay<end>
<start>maybe i am confused<end>
<start>well if to control it it is the moment he got the cruel look<end>
<start>i had latency<end>
<start>nan really mb ptdrrrrrr<end>
<start>wait for meiiiii<end>
<start>logic would like him to finish shadow-slave in volume<end>
<start>normally it is obliged to answer may be he was already gone before he could hear the question<end>
<start>except if it is a theory<end>
<start>not clearly not<end>
<start>but it still titillates me<end>
<start>a little bit of a revenge in real life<end>
<start>or a few months max<end>
<start>well we are talking about her she is not talking about her own desire to go but about her empathy for her adoptive parents who have already lost a child so she is trying to legitimize this ban on sunny<end>
<start>the end is super brutal<end>
<start>cassia prophecies can also be metaphoric<end>
<start>it is crazy not to put that kind of information on the wiki<end>
<start>bah precisely it shows to what fate the guide to them and now that he has more destiny he has learned or are the others directly x<end>
<start>of whom<end>
<start>good go on this good reading to you mwa it is dodo<end>
<start>yen really is<end>
<start>yeah that is far away<end>
<start>medium because sunny says that with the domain of daeron he will be able to make a kind of shadow as if lassimilated to his own future domain<end>
<start>you scavage your best friend then you want to make up for it by wishing anniv shibalaugh<end>
<start>sunny will go<end>
<start>i think that is it<end>
<start>we got something i feel like<end>
<start>divine primordial chaos of the shadow<end>
<start>of memory after it is ptet that the trade but it is nothing in capital<end>
<start>the lord of terror apart from his transfo i have not seen too much of what he is doing yet but the robber that all the soldiers have the shivers sah reading this cbpray<end>
<start>and nobody else except jet<end>
<start>for me the stuff was the material the neph technique and the enchantments to put on<end>
<start>at least i do not think so<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewneeraj-chopra-shows-his-magic-and-qualified-for-javelin-finals-with-a-monster-throw-neeraj-chopra-qualified-javelin-monster-throw-gif-<end>
<start>aled<end>
<start>mmh i do not know we are talking about sunny<end>
<start>it is not going to be that but it is very likely that it is part of her face<end>
<start>there is something i am asking too what is the exact factor so that qqn forgets what sunny says<end>
<start>between having to bear efficace and their kid while he is only waking up he really had to do something to weaver to get there<end>
<start>a little bad explains about the end i know too much how explains the feeling that it makes me mb<end>
<start>prono the clan house of night and the clan song will join<end>
<start>nan on the other hand i am really the theorizer i think i am<end>
<start>prover<end>
<start>the daron of whom<end>
<start>jsp because the author insists a lot on the team work that multiplies the capacities of a group<end>
<start>he did not exist<end>
<start>rest in peace caster<end>
<start>but i am on a while ago he is talking about his but his date<end>
<start>it is too funny to love this fucking work<end>
<start>then we are probably going to have explanations later when they are going to fight the sovereigns<end>
<start>it is forbidden on the g-serve so it is also forbidden here<end>
<start>force to sunny who will be beaten by the sovereigns<end>
<start>it is gone like in<end>
<start>tkt would not read ahah<end>
<start>now that we know how the deamons are<end>
<start>force to you pephethankful<end>
<start>if it is got to come from someone the comeback of sunny will come from cassie<end>
<start>then bam erases<end>
<start>very likely<end>
<start>i correct its<end>
<start>tisacry<end>
<start>i have already passed x<end>
<start>good little chapters that relay us in cliffhanger catscream<end>
<start>if in the last chapter we see that she has the tattoo<end>
<start>we soon had the appearance of the master of the mountain of the first nightmare of sunny and the immortal saint of the second nightmare but apart from that actually few apparitions<end>
<start>and that it is not good for humanity to live in the kingdom of dreams<end>
<start>he must absolutely kill corrupt people to climb<end>
<start>and i remembered i was comparing to pokemon<end>
<start>aaahh<end>
<start>but he also said that his fault was in the real world so we must not ignore it<end>
<start>well i was talking about<end>
<start>she just had too much remorse to tell her pq<end>
<start>with goliath<end>
<start>paste the chicken that arrives<end>
<start>g cannot just make spawn a shadow creation like that<end>
<start>rather than hatred i think they feel a mutual fear towards each other<end>
<start>it is such a mess the tomb of ariel<end>
<start>and her mother dies in the chapter<end>
<start>before morgan decided to make him knight the other leaders proposed to kill him because it would be simpler<end>
<start>well there is just going to be the nephsunny relationship<end>
<start>neither do i how you explain all the categories door and not all awaken an aspect of divine rank<end>
<start>wallah i am not waiting<end>
<start>i am in love<end>
<start>what a madness<end>
<start>i do this to avoid spoil ptdrrrr<end>
<start>for<end>
<start>because in itself the weapon of nephis it will make almost as snake it will evolve with it as snake evolu with sunny<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewkung-fu-master-nod-agree-beard-gif-<end>
<start>or so i understood travial<end>
<start>memory is not much more<end>
<start>but it is at least i get stuff<end>
<start>he is been watching things that normally nothing can survive<end>
<start>good<end>
<start>of the cursed<end>
<start>i do not know what to say<end>
<start>thank you cbpray<end>
<start>you give it to a nightmare and it is ciao<end>
<start>i think he suspects something but have no proof and seen the attention they have on them he can do nothing directly<end>
<start>not since yesterday was chapter and today<end>
<start>weaver creates the exitlege in order to create superpowerful wakes so weaver wants nephis to destroy the exitlege so that there can no longer be hyperpowerful shibalaugh<end>
<start>mdrrr you are going to get her away from that one<end>
<start>yes as sunny<end>
<start>and wings<end>
<start>of the powers from the god of shadow a line of daemon it makes a kind of superpowerful metisse we see the result of this weapon it even frees from the sons of destiny<end>
<start>sunny of the pass is strong that that of the present<end>
<start>are too important for the end of the story<end>
<start>or on the shore forgets it depends on what it counts as a meeting<end>
<start>i just got spoiled by a webnovel email ptdrrrrrrrr<end>
<start>a little respect for her poor girl is she going to carry valor in the war<end>
<start>asterion no idea he has left to be special<end>
<start>but i am sorry mtn i know the webnovel<end>
<start>leave my guy alone<end>
<start>and cassia neither<end>
<start>actually i do not think nephis has a really centered aspect on power in combat regeneration while the aspect of sunny is more utility but i would say that nephis wins but that it would be greenhouse<end>
<start>it is active here<end>
<start>the sortlege is a weaving<end>
<start>i imagine sunny craft a memory that allows to reverse the default for jet<end>
<start>it is hard to say but even me<end>
<start>like i have often rehearsed it is bizzare cassie has led sunny so that he has certain accurate memory that allowed them to survive in this nightmare it is a little over<end>
<start>you are up to date<end>
<start>if she knew she was going to forget everything she would logically note everything but she did not<end>
<start>but c to get out of the rdr for me<end>
<start>forcedly<end>
<start>its default<end>
<start>it was the skin walker who made them flee into the desert and enter the same nightmare<end>
<start>i do not know which one is at valor's<end>
<start>save your tears for later tkt shibalagh<end>
<start>you scare me<end>
<start>there is not all that fear of yeah and if it goes wrong and everything<end>
<start>we all knew i think that the sunny domain would have something to do with the shadows in its soul but having the confirmation is a banger<end>
<start>mwa i know<end>
<start>the saints of the second nightmare<end>
<start>anyhow it is balanced from one day to the next<end>
<start>shut up<end>
<start>psq basically he gets rid of the identity of sunny before the volume<end>
<start>after i think none of the shadows will die<end>
<start>i think she is talking about one of the chicks in the cohort after jsp who in particular<end>
<start>it was time<end>
<start>i am a man<end>
<start>i mean really really<end>
<start>his walk i will see his<end>
<start>to the godly limit of shadows at the end of the story and again it sucks that makes hyper click<end>
<start>but in any case on the basic debate an impure beast exterminates a titan sleeping at least we agree on this<end>
<start>dcp tonight a chap<end>
<start>so sunny has a clone that takes care of the shop in the bastion and then there is him in the cabin around the lake another clone that fights monsters and another one who takes care of his bridge<end>
<start>and how he manages the consistency of the facts passed<end>
<start>it will be the end of slavic shadow<end>
<start>i confess to respect the<end>
<start>on the other hand there is a detail that makes me tilt but i have had to know of the bleakness that sunny did mdr by what he is threshold to betise is quite high<end>
<start>and a shadow that followed noctis but that is not very important<end>
<start>and yes the agreement is written that is how i got it x<end>
<start>yup<end>
<start>yeah okay<end>
<start>that would be giga funny sah<end>
<start>i do not think there is going to be a spectacular crazy ending<end>
<start>it is almost sure he can do it at some point<end>
<start>yeah i forgot something like that<end>
<start>it may be me but there is a flaw i cannot write<end>
<start>bah the line of the god of the heart the god of the heart is also the god of the soul<end>
<start>it ends at the very end of the volume i think<end>
<start>but nobody at the store remembers sunny<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewwhat-what-shocked-jean-luc-melenchon-gif-<end>
<start>i do not know why i remember a line in the chapter explaining that her mother falls or i do not know what she would die<end>
<start>we cannot know until we know what the famous weaver action is<end>
<start>it is immune to the attacks of the soul<end>
<start>at the same time he could not too much not swing cassy in this situation shibalaugh<end>
<start>after maybe it is something else but i do not see what<end>
<start>in the middle of the thing it turned into people dcp and not<end>
<start>after as sunny l explains it does not pose such a problem here<end>
<start>and change of instant pov<end>
<start>for sinister rock which is relatively average among the saints it took sunny and neph max power and they when even almost died the ladders are not the same but neph does not solo a sovereign even outside his domain<end>
<start>with clones that do different activities<end>
<start>i confess my bad<end>
<start>aaaahh the memory that he recyou against the dragon i had forgotten<end>
<start>moments revelation in shadow slave<end>
<start>as she has suppositions she does not forget<end>
<start>and the years of ellipse have advanced them as they are a little in a dead end they focus a little more on their relationship rather than just become stronger<end>
<start>minimum chaps for us<end>
<start>that is normal<end>
<start>with imagination his can be made also i think<end>
<start>he is a good one<end>
<start>salvation all the world is what someone could explain to me the use of the shadow lantern<end>
<start>she has a real name<end>

<start>missing more than cassied to fuck up and we are good<end>
<start>ptdrr nan<end>
<start>the wounds crossed the estuary to invade the next loop and arrived in the sunny temporalite then after some time the moment where the braves incarnate came to sunny and the others arrived in the bodies that were destined for them who respawned thanks to the loop while the invaders came from the pass were already the<end>
<start>ha yes no beast<end>
<start>i think her will walk in relation to her dark sense will determine the limits of her domain<end>
<start>real point for breakie<end>
<start>but i wanted to know about the next shabalaugh<end>
<start>yes but the more mtn i think<end>
<start>effie almost finished his development may be a death in his entourage or while cassie is waiting for a sad continuitefin to cloture the character well<end>
<start>if she was really dead papapaaaaa<end>
<start>cassie has planned almost everything that has happened to them since the exit of the dream kingdom i believe<end>
<start>it is so amazing<end>
<start>i also think that cassie only has vision of the old future before sunny is a variable and therefore if sunny changes anything then cassie will not be able to see the future anymore because it will change<end>
<start>i did not like that part but then it is heavy<end>
<start>we will have a big fight sunny vs nephis soon<end>
<start>if we are really nice ptdrrrr<end>
<start>psq the fact that they forget every time<end>
<start>to have a master he needs his real name and to get him back i guess he has to beat the bird in the pyramid<end>
<start>why in a side story you have to believe it<end>
<start>the first yeah<end>
<start>good luck guys sava do bad pephethink<end>
<start>it is chap per day on average that is it<end>
<start>it is okay<end>
<start>do not worry about it<end>
<start>technically it is a chips<end>
<start>because i thought he was visiting bastion just because he wanted to complete the weaves<end>
<start>since it has no lady core<end>
<start>thank you for the chaps<end>
<start>i think the dream god was really wiped out<end>
<start>i did not understand about it<end>
<start>it was so scary lo mdr<end>
<start>tomorrow<end>
<start>but normals are out of order<end>
<start>if you did not think what about volume t one of the rare do not i did not have the opinion<end>
<start>a whole church it will blow me down<end>
<start>yet he does not seem to pass such a bad rdv the sunny<end>
<start>after ya full of doors that come not from people had divine aspects the doors of low rank<end>
<start>but not the influence cannot be foreseen<end>
<start>short and you have the chapter for this memory too or not<end>
<start>if not i invented his name<end>
<start>and with jet at a time also just before sanitation against winter bet they had a little consumption<end>
<start>it is crazy<end>
<start>in<end>
<start>believe me when you dive in it you do not grow up shibalaugh<end>
<start>if his strength binds to the exitlege but the way does it work is different than you explain<end>
<start>i am blind<end>
<start>perso feminin is the best for me<end>
<start>he is invincible<end>
<start>my girl respects cassie<end>
<start>g really likes changing pov at the worst time<end>
<start>i could have just for the troll<end>
<start>sunny is born more fate so cassie is not supposed to have visions of him not<end>
<start>except that there is also the curse of the oblivion daemon that comes into play<end>
<start>when it is great huh<end>
<start>i am not used to seeing guys talking to pebbles so i am having a hard time making a difference<end>
<start>ahhhh ok that is for sure it is monstrous as a rhythm<end>
<start>it is just psq he is got nothing<end>
<start>can be an imaginary domain because i believe its power tends on this kind of thing<end>
<start>to be able to do my theory from earlier chap<end>
<start>already the bird thief he did not rip off one thing<end>
<start>httpsdiscordcomchannels<end>
<start>i am kind of pissed off than anything else<end>
<start>oe but bof<end>
<start>i agree but at the level of the sense i find it more just without<end>
<start>oh crazy<end>
<start>i think it ends on a mini ellipse into the beginning of the battle and appearance of asterion<end>
<start>but you are crazy<end>
<start>what do i say a leaf physics has<end>
<start>i will never read in english that is dead<end>
<start>maybe an increase in its affinity attribute with shadows<end>
<start>force to you<end>
<start>it was at the time now that there are more saints and more experiments i think we find saints more powerful than they have the time<end>
<start>there is not one of the gods who is the god of forgetfulness and the same is the god of dreams<end>
<start>well something nicer for them<end>
<start>good people<end>
<start>o you have hit a deter<end>
<start>i even said it could go somewhere else<end>
<start>i am sorry i did not make a mistake<end>
<start>too smart a cassy<end>
<start>small single chap<end>
<start>it is going to be a crazy power that the sneakers cannot forget<end>
<start>for me the guy at the end could not talk because he was dead shibalaugh<end>
<start>for spoil<end>
<start>damage<end>
<start>kai manipulates emotions<end>
<start>okay i was scared<end>
<start>we remember there was writing on it grated like attention to vows<end>
<start>it is true but just look if he brings back supreme creatures even would be completely abused even for saints<end>
<start>very likely<end>
<start>do not talk too fast because you do not know what can happen to cassie man shibalaugh<end>
<start>exactly<end>
<start>the return of the goat anyway<end>
<start>and not the last i hope there is interest in having an echo or at least that snake often transforms into him later<end>
<start>if not english is learnt fast<end>
<start>yeah smart<end>
<start>ever more<end>
<start>it was not the best call to start over now i think<end>
<start>pass present and future<end>
<start>or late chaps it changes nothing we will have our almost daily chaps in qlq days so tqtp<end>
<start>jsp see a battle do not we already know the outcome that i did not necessarily interest myself<end>
<start>nonam<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>if weaver knows there is nothing to break since it was planned<end>
<start>between her rune research<end>
<start>stone<end>
<start>i am in pain so i am going to have to beat him up<end>
<start>but c its transfo in dirty mode so y means c different<end>
<start>she said what preference it remains<end>
<start>the volume where he spoke to a rock<end>
<start>oh man i just read the chap d'ares but i am fucking sorry my church la<end>
<start>so cassie performed her thing at the same time that fate was present<end>
<start>and kai<end>
<start>i did not expect what he said about his laughter jai<end>
<start>after that too soon to theorise on weaver jpense<end>
<start>yeah that is a while ago i thought it was a snake's ability but i had a doubt when i was<end>
<start>big parenthese finish again the normal course of the salon<end>
<start>prince of nothing is precis enough for him<end>
<start>and mm for us<end>
<start>it is true that everyone who wants to discuss it is here<end>
<start>it is true but like all the other divine aspects yes yen is that two other shibalaugh on a hyper powerful ability but which requires to destroy a kernel i thought that sunny could have one as well but that he has not discovered unlocked yet<end>
<start>only if you are reading<end>
<start>maybe it is sunny who brought back quentin from the antarctic<end>
<start>for me he killed nephis with the rage of the crown but were not yet cooppu<end>
<start>the mad prince is smart<end>
<start>and they have the government and survivors of the weapon<end>
<start>a ok<end>
<start>thin before it was sin of loneliness i had trouble with the new tradrigole<end>
<start>otherwise sunny is a little sadistic<end>
<start>it is true that if he is supreme he will get run over by sunny and nephis supreme shibalaugh<end>
<start>i was going to vote again<end>
<start>she is just perfect<end>
<start>we will get more info when asterion arrives in the lintrigue probably<end>
<start>at least sunny is not<end>
<start>your vrmt boss thanks anyway<end>
<start>and i do not think he is going to stop right now<end>
<start>in real life i do not think g ecrive side story at the end of ss shibalaugh<end>
<start>yes but the no-weaver line is the god's line forgets about it<end>
<start>maybe i am looking for it after all but good hutaowant<end>
<start>for me they are especially not governed by the system of rank and class<end>
<start>limit it<end>
<start>in real life all the creatures that have become shadows in the mother of soul of sunny they have no utilite in combat<end>
<start>it may be probable but not unlikely i think<end>
<start>or effie<end>
<start>mrc gray<end>
<start>yeah frankly it is too heavy<end>
<start>before<end>
<start>it was on mdr<end>
<start>sunny no<end>
<start>for lack of time i am on vacation and yesterday i got stuck h roads h tattoo<end>
<start>just that he left before the question and here he is<end>
<start>yes out of their domain but knowing their fault remains the safest thing<end>
<start>and he said to avoid watching the moon<end>
<start>on the moon<end>
<start>i did not think though<end>
<start>its cursed epee<end>
<start>eg history with the<end>
<start>see how i was hurting my head is always the case so much i had the hatred of what happened to him<end>
<start>may be a shadwing drill of something else<end>
<start>or conflict<end>
<start>if a shadow should die i think it would be fielon because snake has too much potential and how to exploit it like this for nightmare with its dream domain i see not holy canner perso<end>
<start>frankly pretty taff<end>
<start>but under what circumstances he will find her like his you will have the repo later<end>
<start>but i did not expect him to appear now<end>
<start>we are not going back to the debate<end>
<start>so i think there is something else too<end>
<start>it is quick he just has to kill humans<end>
<start>the one that sunny got is vrmt thanks to a sick plan that he got it and bcp bcp lucky that the god of the late shadow his version in the nightmare kills the king of the mountains<end>
<start>he is got gold in his hands<end>
<start>his steps gray who chose<end>
<start>possible<end>
<start>i agree that if a member of the cohort dies it would be broken even if i do not think it is happening at least for a while<end>
<start>one does not prevent the other shibalaugh<end>
<start>in any case the sunphis he eats well at the moment sscassiepopcorn<end>
<start>yep it is the dream world that corrupts the real world<end>
<start>if they are born by vacuum<end>
<start>see if we can get him back along the way<end>
<start>nowhere is personal<end>
<start>beluga<end>
<start>when nothing<end>
<start>anvil family meeting which then tells her sunny that they are your future plans<end>
<start>of course but there is a difference between being stronger and a v<end>
<start>how we put the thing that censors the message<end>
<start>he did not know yet what he had to do to a murdering prince shimaaugh<end>
<start>i would not have put my piece on jet anymore<end>
<start>yeah but when i read it i think i am going to get it<end>
<start>especially since the world we know is the last<end>
<start>but they all have the same line they come from the same person<end>
<start>because all the actions of the sunny of passing pass her in the seed and not in the tomb<end>
<start>i am finally up to date it is funny we should be happy but i feel like the price he is going to pay for his choice is not going to be easy for example that cassie is going to die or something<end>
<start>the crown i do not see where you get it he just needs to observe it and understand his style<end>
<start>it is true that their aspects are pretty much linked to it but for now we are not sure<end>
<start>as long as it does not take too much place in the writing of the people and the advancement of history does not bother me<end>
<start>and no one should remember the mask<end>
<start>i was going to say that he might find the rest in the kingdom of shadow but what part of the kingdom of dreams corresponds to the kingdom of shadow<end>
<start>it is not said that it is deplacable<end>
<start>ahahahahahahahahahahahahahah<end>
<start>oh nephis<end>
<start>good finally it reached the estuary<end>
<start>from what i understood the sortlege only accentuates and accelerates the reception of a fragment lady it serves just as channelizer or the reply of the author<end>
<start>yeah so he is a cheese hair<end>
<start>i guess weaver wants to be the only daemon so he will rise again when sunny gets all the weaving back<end>
<start>the answer to the pk not is that this war was important giga for song and valor and that if she were there she would fuck valor to make the different we saw the power of an anvil soverrain that spawn with its rain depee and you think she would have let her clan make a pretend degalite and lose saints and her masters<end>
<start>of the corrupt titan winter beast<end>
<start>in real life it is possible<end>
<start>he would never even find it<end>
<start>i do not think so long as his<end>
<start>rdr<end>
<start>also i think the nephi transfo will be a phoenix<end>
<start>after that he was the only one who protected nephis<end>
<start>but it will surprise me<end>
<start>in my head the rank you are given is the max you will reach<end>
<start>i have a question the winter beast comes from the cursed desert or not<end>
<start>he is just planning a bastion attack<end>
<start>okay<end>
<start>only small regret is that i could not put my little comments under the chaps every day i miss it peepocrywhy<end>
<start>just jealousy<end>
<start>he ping in<end>
<start>or fight with the shadows<end>
<start>we do not know<end>
<start>to transform it into a semi-superior memory<end>
<start>pleases its detractors<end>
<start>if you do not you will have to go home<end>
<start>if i am right sahh<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewkuzco-yzma-manigance-evil-plan-machiavcalique-gif-<end>
<start>maybe gray made a change<end>
<start>but he is not completely free from fate either<end>
<start>he figured out what happened<end>
<start>damn the last chap i screamed first degres<end>
<start>okay well i had zap<end>
<start>weaver of fate<end>
<start>outside the yup line<end>
<start>he sold them and he did tests that had to take time before being conclusive<end>
<start>and i think i do not have enough left<end>
<start>well i thought that is all sleepers<end>
<start>and it is gone he does not want to kill for no reason he feels guilty when the integralite of the military base gets shot while he runs away<end>
<start>seeing that sunny screwed up<end>
<start>yeah but i said to myself in view of the fact that he nephis and bitrates are special because of their divine aspect and their line<end>
<start>average ya in real life would be cool<end>
<start>the other damn nice side is that you can come here without being afraid<end>
<start>you read the paying chapters<end>
<start>his means that he had no transfo what i do not find logical<end>
<start>otherwise cassie will make the rapprochement with sunny of the bar<end>
<start>amazing mdrr these titles<end>
<start>i just did not say anything<end>
<start>princess of war<end>
<start>kappayl<end>
<start>forgive<end>
<start>small titan dilemma sleeping or impure beast<end>
<start>but you bet on whose death<end>
<start>barely a week in advance in bulk<end>
<start>i wonder if the day or one of us gets gauled and he is actually facing a judicial sanction<end>
<start>i do not think fate is broken after all we will see all sunny's friends come back he just lost the exit leg<end>
<start>but he really put me in pls mdrrr<end>
<start>ah not wrong<end>
<start>miam<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewvilebrequin-vilbrequin-sylvain-sylvain-vilebrequin-stone-gif-<end>
<start>he just needs to pull out the big toe extra<end>
<start>she will scavenger the goat too<end>
<start>but we see her way of approaching the fight more instinctive than nephis she must have more qi she has returned to the base and everything<end>
<start>we do not know yet the aspects of daron a neph and asterion<end>
<start>ptet the author said<end>
<start>as the world i think<end>
<start>since asterion would have no reason to go see sunny<end>
<start>one lice<end>
<start>i would have to reread to make a real ranking<end>
<start>mdrrrrr the competition is dead<end>
<start>i read paragraph xd twice<end>
<start>biased opinion i am the trad so by definition i kiff as much as the others<end>
<start>what does it mean to purify the world<end>
<start>sound<end>
<start>it is weird to follow the slice of life in quoti<end>
<start>yeah he is got some crazy skills right next door<end>
<start>thank you for the trad i just saw there is a small she will at the end of the kia brand instead of kai<end>
<start>the skin walkers of the desert that turns the corpses into corrupt creatures or superior i do not know anymore it is a terror or a tyrant<end>
<start>with super appearances of jsp what<end>
<start>just do not compare we do not know enough to say<end>
<start>but she will hear the lord of shadows she will ask the question<end>
<start>but as it develops according to humanity is what it is not just the too limited number of sovereigns that would limit that i know more exactly how it is written<end>
<start>okay i see thanks<end>
<start>he makes me think a little bit of modret<end>
<start>kai's never in my cyou are<end>
<start>since real names are often linked to the nature of people<end>
<start>holy is not dead in the nightmare facing the butcher<end>
<start>it went over her body<end>
<start>cases my goat<end>
<start>you are going to read big shit<end>
<start>come to theorize with us<end>
<start>tyrant<end>
<start>you are going to be able to update yourself for peaks chap<end>
<start>he gave her the black snake<end>
<start>you are soon on the watch<end>
<start>like the beasts' mistress<end>
<start>thank you very much<end>
<start>even with context especially that there is no context at all shibalaugh<end>
<start>what the chain breaker is wanking already<end>
<start>because it is qqun who is not supposed to exist and has left no trace in destiny<end>
<start>he is going to get us through all the other characters before he comes back to sunnycassie<end>
<start>if holy dies i am sad<end>
<start>the other reasons in question she wanted her personal show shibalaugh shibalaugh<end>
<start>it is character development that your living<end>
<start>daeron did not cross his future when he entered the nightmare<end>
<start>and does not master it but is destiny<end>
<start>i will keep reading<end>
<start>i had like - good paws but i am never going that far<end>
<start>i agree<end>
<start>there is already a small decalage<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewbatman-no-not-impressed-nope-never-gif-<end>
<start>it appeared in the fleet before finding the piece of boat with drive it seems to me<end>
<start>or cross them and just say he is not dead vrm<end>
<start>i knew and he was happy<end>
<start>a limit a cursed beast with a lot of preparation etc it can be a little unplayable and still<end>
<start>i think the opposite of you for effie and kai<end>
<start>i think it is permanent<end>
<start>you did not say but it is interesting<end>
<start>yeah i understand<end>
<start>but by far what<end>
<start>start volume<end>
<start>maybe he is talking about kimmy luster and quentin maybe beth too i see that in any case<end>
<start>personal i think she left a subliminal message of sunny but not direct kind you are going to forget an important guy who is going to trust fate but with some sunny description for her memory but again not direct as her this is not erased by destiny<end>
<start>probably during the dream of the last nightmare<end>
<start>euuh<end>
<start>so actually she is a fan of no one<end>
<start>like above arthur prime<end>
<start>sovereign may have been more of the rating of the divinity kind angel<end>
<start>his holy attribute is far too strong<end>
<start>and do not have to be too sovereign<end>
<start>mtn it can easy dodge<end>
<start>and the cautionary against this project misrepresents the fact that it plays against her<end>
<start>as it is in good term with effiy for example<end>
<start>shadow him echoes<end>
<start>there is another theory that bites infiltrated the house of the night and would be their new leader of course he saves nothing but thanks to his he could have formed a beginning of alliance with song but no luck he encounters the walker by little and otherwise the theory robber of me skin walker i think his possibilities to see himself as his gives because technically a nightmare his a scenario that does not touch the reality but with the tomb one is never at the end of no surprises<end>
<start>it is gray the real monster here xd<end>
<start>ahhh if<end>
<start>brook of the shore forgets was super long at some point i had almost caught i believe lantarctic i find that it was more fun to read<end>
<start>that is the one who asked<end>
<start>between kai nephis sunny<end>
<start>it is going to be great the interactions between sunny and kai<end>
<start>i am you the beginning of the next volume is on groove genre - chap<end>
<start>she will see a weaver mask especially<end>
<start>no i cannot resist a shadow-slave turn degre<end>
<start>we saw his future version in the estuary<end>
<start>but it is still a little dishonest on the part of cassie not to wash off consequences<end>
<start>awhupopcorn<end>
<start>and even now that he can have several bodies at the same time he can technically return to infinity<end>
<start>after that goes on the chaps i was late i have more than<end>
<start>a godgrave<end>
<start>- effie<end>
<start>yeah well that is what he said<end>
<start>that is it<end>
<start>the normals must wake<end>
<start>cheaper<end>
<start>and i wonder what the nighthouse is going to be like it would be weird if they were just going to get laid by the other clans without doing anything<end>
<start>but the one in the black quote is one of the two great priests it is the only one who had masks of divine rank<end>
<start>we do not know<end>
<start>really bites her<end>
<start>we did not have to start in<end>
<start>dogsmile<end>
<start>it is short by chapter the content is genial the writing is top c'enchaine y'a from everything in so in real life it is perfect to start<end>
<start>i was going to write the story<end>
<start>i think on the contrary that he was there for spawn kill the piaf to recover his destiny just after wasting time is a little confused at the bottom<end>
<start>no memory<end>
<start>mdr i found the moment we talked about it<end>
<start>sunny did not take the place of its future version since its corrupt version was the<end>
<start>but she will not have any appearance<end>
<start>the two go together i would tend to say that has purification if not a history of destruction<end>
<start>it would not surprise me yes it will explain how he could break his bond even if it remains a theory since the light guide shows a name that does not seem to be known by sunny<end>
<start>and without a real name you have no destiny<end>
<start>because it is very hard to find the chap en vo out of the classic site<end>
<start>agawrgurapopcorn<end>
<start>but it is very likely they have it<end>
<start>imagining a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of<end>
<start>there will be plenty to discuss<end>
<start>anyhow it is the death of effie or cassie i admit that effie would be more likely it will ruin this relationship with everyone<end>
<start>if sunny had not found the first drop dichor thanks to the fate attribute we would not have had any history<end>
<start>really the amazing phrase<end>
<start>between goliath titan dechu and daeron bete superieure you think it is who wins<end>
<start>it is going to be crazy the end of the nightmare and the nightmare<end>
<start>or she would have gone crazy<end>
<start>yespp<end>
<start>we are going to call it like that<end>
<start>jthinks that it is top widely<end>
<start>perfect thanks<end>
<start>running gag bees jen can more g it is a kid mdr<end>
<start>already he did not really need to fight full power since he is a saint and then ok if he invokes several bodies it is cool but he cannot boost himself with the shadow at the same time so it is not necessarily the top and then he tries as a shadow lord to keep his secret abilities to the max<end>
<start>that is exactly the point<end>
<start>yeah really it was the essence of g's work and talent<end>
<start>i am having a little trouble in the english version i understand but it is a very tiring matter<end>
<start>not on the contrary<end>
<start>ah and they put years in spawn<end>
<start>rollover with cassy<end>
<start>yeah but it proves that if she cannot reach her target she is usless<end>
<start>i have been going to fix everything since the beginning but if in the end they are still in there i will shoot myself<end>
<start>httpstenorcomviewelmo-shrug-who-knows-gif-<end>
<start>your conversation will not go any further make sure to respect the rules of the show emiliahappy<end>
<start>he even says he transcended<end>
<start>we have not discovered the sovereign yet<end>
<start>if reread the chapter or he tests with his says<end>
<start>while if he had chosen to stay with the link he would just stay on the boat<end>
<start>nan after<end>
<start>yeah not fake<end>
<start>the last her means what her<end>
<start>we do not know the max door of the nuke yet<end>
<start>year would be the best from my point of view is the perfect between two i find<end>
<start>wah wah wah wah<end>
<start>we should make an inventory each<end>
<start>it is not pov sunny<end>
<start>you think after the nightmare weaver has no control over what is going to happen to sunny<end>
<start>hutaoyan<end>
<start>yeah<end>
<start>already good courage to him and normally not<end>
<start>may be when he is even stronger in witchcraft<end>
<start>and it could be the angel of the prophety<end>
<start>good friends it is time for me to finish the nightmare i was stopping at the moment where sunny part to the estuary jen expects a lot of this end volume that i think will be my favorite<end>
<start>i just want him to have more screen time<end>
<start>what arc<end>
